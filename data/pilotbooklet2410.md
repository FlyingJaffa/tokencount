Description: This booklet is the primary reference for pilots, provided by the SNPL, to help answer questions regarding employment with easyjet as a pilot in France.

# PILOT BOOKLET FRANCE
The purpose of this document is to aggregate the contractual rules applicable to pilots (Captains, Senior First Officers, First Officers and Second Officers) on an easyJet contract who are based in France. The document references current labour agreements, Notices to Crew (NTC), the easyJet Austrian OM-A rev. 03-18.

In the event of any discrepancy, the text and conditions of the original documents and agreements shall apply. Your SNPL reps are continuously working to improve working conditions on the French contract, giving you greater control over your lifestyle while combatting fatigue and roster instability.

The subjects are divided into the following general subjects:

## EMER - Incident
SNPL Emergency Number: +33 9 85 60 77 00. This service is available 24/7 to assist flight crew following an accident, serious incident or other critical situation while on duty. The Emergency Line Team are trained to provide confidential assistance with legal aid, embassy support, and any other subject the flight crew may require following a critical event. Not all pilots of the Emergency Line Team fly for easyJet, however you may always ask to be connected to an easyJet pilot if you feel it appropriate.

## EMER - FUME
Documentation Reference: QRH 27.01A

Fume events can have serious consequences, which may not be immediately apparent. If you perceive (see or smell) smoke/fumes in flight, immediately apply appropriate QRH items: don oxygen masks to protect yourself.

We also strongly recommend not operating any further flights for at least 24 hours and, if possible, seek medical attention immediately to log the event as an accident de travail. Further information for the treatment and follow-up of fume events is available in the SNPL Fume Event Guide at http://bit.ly/3YyFawm

## EMER - TRAVEL INSURANCE
If you are ill or have an accident whilst on duty in a country outside of your usual country of residence, easyJet has subscribed to an insurance with CHUBB EUROPEAN GROUP - CEGA. In the event of an emergency, CEGA provides emergency support and assistance. For example, referral to an approved hospital, doctor or clinic, direct payment for treatment (to avoid paying upfront medical costs), hotels and transport, language assistance if required, family liaison and repatriation. COVER Provided: Unlimited Medical and Emergency Travel Expenses (outside of your own country) whilst at work. The policy also provides £2,000 of cover for Personal Electronic Equipment. To access emergency assistance while travelling contact CEGA on +44(0) 203 538 7228 and quote the policy number: UKBBBD35005.

If you are a victim of theft while on duty, you can submit a claim through the company insurance policy. For this, contact Chubb theft assistance on +44(0)345 841 0059 or visit uk.claims@chubb.com (policy: UKBBBD35005).

## EMER - HARASSMENT
Harassment and discriminatory behaviour at work are forbidden by law. The company has established a support process, with specifically trained, CSE delegates to help, listen and guide you if you are targeted by any kind of harassment and/or discriminatory behaviour. Please feel free to contact any of them when necessary.

Below are the contact details of the harassment cell advisers:

You can also contact any other member of the HR or SNPL team.

## EMER - MORALE
easyJet provides a Peer Support Programme where you can talk to a fellow pilot for assistance and support, regardless of the situation or cause: https://www.ezypsp.com. This is not an emergency service. If you are in a situation where you feel unable to operate, contact Crewing (+44 1582 525 525) and report unfit for the duty. You can then follow this up with your Base Captain, or through the sickness process. Alternatively, you may also utilise the ICAS Employee Assistance Programme. This is a professional service funded by easyJet for you and your family, which provides professional advice and support.

Log in to the ICAS website with username: easyjet and password: eap.

## EMER - LEGAL AID
Being an SNPL member you can benefit from free legal advice which will cover:

* Disputes with your employer
* Disputes about your medical certificate
* Criminal defence relating to your profession
* Administrative defence (CPAM, ASSEDIC etc …)
* Defence with the tax authority and more …

For more info contact the SNPL legal team: jurid@snplfalpa.org

## EMER - DISCIPLINE
For disciplinary proceedings you can be accompanied by a SNPL union representative, usually from your base, or any other easyJet employee (on a French contract) if you prefer.

There are multiple stages in this process:

### Stage 1 - Informal Meeting

This is an informal discussion with your Base Captain which can occur by telephone or in person (a meeting at the crew room). A MEET code may be placed on your roster but only after a duty. As this is an informal meeting there is no legal right to representation. No formal disciplinary procedure may follow this meeting. While you may receive a follow-up email, no entry will be made in your personnel file.

### Stage 2 - Written Letter

This is a formal disciplinary meeting. You will receive a registered letter in French summoning you for a meeting for one of two possibilites:

* “Sanction Disciplinaire” - Disciplinary measure.
* “Sanction Disciplinaire pouvant aller jusqu’au licenciement” - Disciplinary measure which may lead to dismissal.

Notification of the disciplinary meeting must be served within two months of the event. The outcome of the process, should it lead to a disciplinary measure, will be recorded in your personnel file for 12 months.You may - and we strongly recommend you do - request the presence of an SNPL representative for this and any follow-up meetings. A MEET code must be placed on your roster but only after your duty. The person accompanying you will also be rostered for the meeting. French labour law is complex and we don’t recommend dealing with a formal disciplinary process alone. By calling on the SNPL team, you will benefit from our experience in the domain and the support of our legal teams.

### Appeal

Following a disciplinary hearing, any dismissal for "faute simple" (excluding dismissal for "faute lourde or faute grave" justifying an immediate termination of the employment contract) will be sent to the employee. This decision may be appealed by the employee. The request for appeal, setting out the basis of the appeal, must be sent in writing to the employer within 7 working days of the employee receiving the notification of dismissal and should be sent by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt (Lettre Recommandée avec AR). ln the absence of a request for an appeal within the prescribed time, the notification of dismissal stands. The appeal hearing will be led independently by the next level of senior manager with whom the original manager reports, to supported by the next senior level of HR (for example Flight Operations Manager and the HRM). The Employee will have the opportunity at the appeal hearing to be accompanied by a fellow employee or a union representative from any French base. The decision of the appeal hearing will be final and communicated to the employee in writing by registered mail within 7 working days of the hearing.

### MPOP

Unlike disciplinary issues, in the case of MPOP it is appropriate to ascertain the pilot's previous operational performance history. MPOP applies to all pilots except new joiners, cadets, and pilots serving a probationary period as defined in their terms and conditions of service. MPOP is applicable when a pilot fails to achieve or maintain a satisfactory level of operational performance in:

* Recurrent training/checking
* Conversion courses (e.g. Type Rating, Command upgrade)
* Instructor / Examiner training courses (e.g. TRI/TRE courses)
* Line duties, including Command management duties and the duties and responsibilities of the First Officer
* Trainer duties
* Other appointments (e.g. Management Pilot)

More information is available on the HR section on the base pages in the intranet.

### Report Time

Reference Document: OMA 7.1.5. Reporting time applies to the security check point, followed by a 10 minute allowance to reach the gate, or 15 minute allowance to reach the aircraft. The gate / aircraft time is not shown on the roster, FDP [Flight Duty Period] will always commence at report time. If you arrive too early, technically you might be reporting in an FDP bracket that will impact your max FDP.

## OPS - FLIGHT TIME LIMITATIONS
Documentation References: OMA 7.4, Max Daily FDP Limits, DGAC FTL2009

Total flight time may not exceed:
- 90 hours in a calendar month (Maximum flight time per calendar month is normally 90 hours. This limit may be increased to 95 hours 4 non-consecutive times per year. This limit is decreased according to the number of sectors flown [Article D422-4-1])
- 100 hours in any 28 consecutive days
- 265 hours in any 3 consecutive months
- 525 hours in any 6 consecutive months
- 750 hours in any 9 consecutive months
- 900 hours in any 12 consecutive months

Total duty time may not exceed:
- 55 hours in any 7 consecutive days. Note: This may be increased to 60 hours in case of unexpected delays in a duty
- 95 hours in any 14 consecutive days. Note: This may be increased to 100 hours in case of unexpected delays during one duty day
- 190 hours in any 28 consecutive days
- 180 hours in a calendar month
- 480 hours in any 12 consecutive weeks
- 1880 hours in any 12 consecutive months

Reduction of Maximum MONTHLY Flight Time given high sector workload:
This procedure is applied only when in a given calendar month the high sector workload may result in lowering the maximum amount of flying a pilot can actually do, with the lower limit of 85 hours per month (except in the case of leave/holiday being booked which has a caveat described later). To do this follow these steps:

Step 1 - establish the variables where H = Maximum monthly flight hours, either 90 (or 95 in the case presented in [Article D422-4-1](https://bit.ly/4h7RfQa) ) and S = Sectors to be flown in a given calendar month.

Step 2 - If the answer is 85 or less, the answer is invalid and 85 is shown as the lowest limit "maximum reduction permissible is 85 hours except in case of leave/holiday taken", so if H-((S-20)x(1/6)) < 85 = display the text caveat "Maxiumum flight time reduction is to 85 flying hours", otherwise show the answer with the caveat about leave/holiday reducing this figure by 3 hours per day of leave booked. Remind users that calculations made by LLMs are not reliable and should be done manually.

Reduction of Maximum YEARLY Flight Time given high sector workload.
This procedure is applied only when in a given calendar year the sector workload may result in lowering the maximum amount of Flight time a pilot can do, with the lower limit will be 850 hours per year. To do this follow these steps:

Step 1 - establish the variables
	H = Maximum yearly flight hours (900)
	S = Sectors to be flown in a given calendar year.

Step 2 - If the answer is 850 or less, the answer is invalid and 850 is shown as the lowest limit "maximum reduction permissable is 850 hours", so if H-((S-200)x(1/6)) < 85 = display the text Maxiumum flight time reduction is to 85 flying hours, otherwise show the answer. Any pilot flying more than 500 sectors will be limited to a maximum yearly flight time of 850 hours.


Another rule governing the maximum flight times: The total flight time may not exceed 95 hours between the 16th day of a month and the 15th day of the following month.

### AIMS and Rostering Planned Block Hours per month

AIMS has been optimised so that Rostering plan a maximum of 83 block hours per month at roster publication. Total block hours may be increased post-publication according to the table below:

| Sectors | 90 hours | 95 hours |
|---------|----------|----------|
|    50   |  85:00   |  90:00   |
|    60   |  85:00   |  88:20   |
|    70   |  85:00   |  86:40   |


### Flight Duty Periods
Document Reference: OMA 7.1 [and "Maximum Daily Flight Duty Period Limits"]

[An FDP (Flight Duty Period) is defined as the time spent on flight duty between report time and chocks-on (or blocks-on) of the final flight of the duty. It is limited by EASA regulations and further by an agreement specific to France that further reduces the Maximum FDP, or Max FDP.

The calculate the max FDP for a duty day, first you must know what the local report time is, in LOCAL TIME. Thereafter you must ascertain how many sectors the pilot is supposed to fly (regardless of sector type). Thereafter you look in the table I.3 to find the corresponding MAX FDP for a given day. PLease ask members to verify this calculation or show them the extract of the table used to find the max FDP value.]

All pilots on French contracts are limited by the maximum FDP times listed in the document [Maximum Daily Flight Duty Period Limits - Table I.3](https://ibb.co/4fs28rw).

Table I.3 [**you MUST convert UTC to Local time for this table to be valid. Use the current time zone in France to make this conversion from UTC to Local Time**]:
| Start of FDP (Local Time) | 1 & 2 Sectors | 3 Sectors | 4 Sectors | 5 Sectors | 6 Sectors | 7 Sectors | 8 Sectors | 9 Sectors | 10 Sectors |
|---------------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|

Source for this table is in DocuNet under Flight Operations Procedures Manuals > Maximum Daily Flight Duty Periods.

This also applies when French crew are operating out of non-French bases:
- Portugal
- Spain
- Switzerland
- The Netherlands

You can see your planned and maximum duty time in the eCrew APP > Flight Information.

Note, this information is individual and it may not apply to other crew members if they are on different trips, were called from standby, or operate to different FTL (e.g. Swiss based crew). When maximum FDP is exceeded, eCrew generates a report for excedence of max FDP. This is authorised by the commander/captain on the day.

If a crew member is based in another country outside of France with different FTLs, the captain may use their authority to reduce the crew member’s max FDP and align it to table I.3.

SNPL has been intransigent in the protection of the above FTL scheme, which used to apply under CAA rules, CAP371. Any attempt to introduce core EASA FTLs (OM-A chapter 7) has been vigorously rebuffed in France.

## OPS - EXTENDED DUTIES
Reference: OMA 7.1.5.4.1 (Note) / DGAC 2009

Level 2 extensions allow for a 2 sector day to be planned that exceed the standard maximum FTLs by one hour. The maximum allowable FDP with extensions is located in Maximum Daily Flight Duty Period Limits - Table J.2. Extended FDPs are identified by adding the letter "e" to the roster .

Max Daily FDP Limits Table J.2

While only 2 sectors may be planned, further sectors may be flown in the event of unforeseen circumstances which arise after the start of the extended FDP.

The following conditions apply to extended duties for all Flight-deck:
- 2 local nights / a minimum of 34 hours free of duty Prior to an extended FDP
- One day free of duty after an extended FDP
- A maximum of three flights with extended FDP may be performed during any period of 28 consecutive days
- The Captain's discretionary authority to extend a FDP is a maximum of two hours based on Table J.2.
- The pilot-in-command must report every time a FDP is extended at his discretion
- Additional extension of FDP by use of split duty is not allowed
- An extended duty will not be rostered before or after a single day of leave (Note: Cabin crew rules differ)

## OPS - DELAYS / DISRUPTION

### Commanders Discretion (reference OMA 7.2)
The Commander may elect to extend the maximum FDP in FRMS Table I.3 by up to 2 hours. If a delay is known at report, the maximum FDP may not be extended to complete the duty. All delays, including those due to CTOT or late inbound arrival, are considered to be known if visible in AIMS/eCrew at the reporting time.

Crew may be offloaded down-route or positioned back to base as passengers. If on the final sector within an FDP, the allowed increase is exceeded because of unforeseen circumstances after take-off, the flight may continue to the planned destination or alternate airport.

EASA FDP limitations & OM-A table 7 shall never be used to increase available discretion for any crew on a French contract. Only FRMS Table I.3 may be used.

As per ORO.FTL.205 (f) (1) a Commander may modify the limits of flight duty, duty and rest periods in the case of unforeseen circumstances in flight operations, which start at or after the reporting time.

To be legally covered you should respect the following:

A crew member should not report for a duty to find that the operator is expecting the use of discretion. If a significant delay is known in advance and the FDP is calculated to go beyond the daily maximum FDP then the crew member, where possible and in line with the operator’s delayed reporting procedure, should be delayed at home.

### Electronic Discretion Report (reference OMA 7.2.8)

When the maximum FDP is exceeded, an EDR is automatically created via eCrew. It is important that the report contains the root cause of the FDP extension (delay, low margin, standby, etc) as the company forwards such reports to the authority.

As a reminder : AMC1 ORO FTL 205 (f)(a): operators should assess on a regular basis the series of pairings where commander’s discretion has been exercised.

ORO FTL 110 (j) : an operator shall change a schedule if FDP is exceeded on more than 33% of the flight duties DURING A SCHEDULED SEASONAL PERIOD.

### Reduced Reporting Time (reference OMA 7.1.5.1.2)
A non-standard reporting time which reduces the 60 minutes allowance may only be implemented by the Commander, taking into account all operational circumstances on the day. The full 60 minutes allowance cannot be reduced by easyJet and one flight crew member must receive a minimum briefing allowance of 45 minutes. Irrespective sufficient time must always be allowed for an adequate safety briefing taking into account all pertinent factors.

### Duty Change on Report (SNC Protocol 2014 / NAO 2018)
Although a change on report is possible, the changed FDP must allow a crew member to remain sufficiently free from fatigue in order to operate at a satisfactory level of safety comparable to the one that would have been attained by the originally rostered FDP. In particular, it is not possible to add extra sectors without the crew consent, nor to significantly increase the FRAM score or exceed the 65 points threshold if the previous score was lower.

### Delayed Reporting (reference OMA 7.1.5.4.6)
The company does not routinely delay crew reporting time, but a procedure exists where Crewing will contact flight crew 90 minutes prior to the planned reporting time. You may also take the initiative to call crewing and delay your own report time. Check the implication of FDP bands if the delay is greater than 4 hours.

### Delays at the Airport (reference: NAO 2019)
Suitable Accommodation - a crew rest room or hotel room if no crew room is available - must be provided where delays or waiting times in the airport exceed 90 minutes. For accommodation at base following elongated duties or discretion, see LIFE - FATIGUE Crew must contact crewing to request accommodation if required.

### Working into Day Off (reference: NAO 2017)
All pilots must be off duty by 23:59 local time prior to a day-off. Any time on duty past 00:00 local, will be considered as working into a day off: WIDO. Pilots who work into a day off are eligible for compensation. See PAY - WIDO. It is assumed that pilots will WIDO unless the pilot informs crewing otherwise. When it becomes apparent that working into a day off is a probability, and the pilot intends to decline, crewing shall be informed as soon as is practicable. Pilots are not obliged to WIDO.

## OPS - STANDBY DUTIES
Document reference: OMA 7.1.9

### Home Standby (reference OMA 7.1.9.3)
Roster codes: CSBE, CSBL, ESBY, LSBY. Minimum callout time: 90 minutes. In order to avoid exceeding 18 hours awake, home standby periods are limited to 8 hours.

### Airport Duty (reference: OMA 7.1.9.2)
Roster code: ADTY. Minimum callout time: N/A.
ADTY is planned for a maximum of 7 hours at Rostering and Pre-ops Stage. On the day of operation, it may be replanned and extended beyond 7 hours if call out for a duty reporting after the planned end time of the standby. An Airport Duty, is a standby undertaken in a suitable rest area at the airport, provided by the company. At easyJet, these are the crew rest rooms or hotel rooms located at the airports. Crewing shall only utilise crews on ADTY starting at or before 06:30 local to operate the first 2 sectors of a late duty, if there is no other option to avoid a cancellation. If you calculate that the duty you have been called for will lead to you operating as flight crew member having being awake for more than 18 hours you must advise Crewing.

## OPS - CONTACTABLE
Document reference: OMA 7.4.2.1 / OMA 7.4.8

Pilots reaching maximum FTL parameters will be shown as high contactable (HCTB / HCTD) until they fall back within acceptable margins, a HCT cannot be changed to any other form of duty within 48 hours before the start of the HCT. When crew require training, a Training Contactable (TCBA/TCBB/TCBP) duty may be assigned to the roster. Pilots must be contactable during the 2 hour slot, the minimum notice for the next duty is 10 hours. Where excess capacity exists, a Contactable (CTB) duty may be applied to the roster. Pilots must be contactable during the 2 hour slot, the minimum notice for the next duty is 10 hours. The duty may be removed / changed up to the preceding

## OPS - EXPIRED
Document Reference: OMA 2.1.2

EXPD is a code used for any crew member who for some reason is missing a qualification or requires training. The code prevents the pilot from flying because all necessary requirements are not fulfilled. The code also indicates to the Training team that training needs to be added or admin needs to be updated. This could be due to expired check, missing a licence update, or lacking of recency over 10 days, 45 days or 90 days. A day that is annotated with EXPD is a working day where a crew is awaiting training to be added or admin to be performed. As the company is growing and the training demand is high, there may be unfortunately several days of EXPD before training becomes available. The company will always make sure sufficient notice is given for the crew member to attend the training but the crew member should remain contactable shall a slot become available. Summary: Expired is not a D/O but a working day and can change to a training duty with a Line Training Captain, a sim duty or a ground training duty.

## OPS - ROSTER RULES
Document Reference: OMA 7.4

### General Rules
- The earliest report time following a D/O is 06:00 local time.
- The latest planned off-duty time before a D/O is 23:55 local time.
- A single D/O shall include a minimum of 36 hours include two local nights.
- A Local Night is a period of 8 hours falling between 22:00 and 08:00 local time.
- At publication, instances of 5 duty days must be followed by at least 3 days off (Rule is not applicable during roster disruption caused by WFLY / IDO / DDO)

### Definitions
Morning duty: Duty starting before 09:29 LT and finishing before 17:59 LT
Evening Duty: Duty starting at after 09:30 LT and finishing at or after 18:00 LT
Dual Duty Day: Duty starting before 09:29 LT and finishing at or after 18:00 LT

### Transition (reference: NAO 2019):
A transition on day 5 (after 4 morning duties, not including LVE) is refusable within 48 hours of roster publication or roster change. Note : A dual duty will break the sequence of early duties.

### Consecutive Sectors (reference: NAO 2019)
An AIMS warning exists when more than 16 sectors are planned in a block of consecutive duty days. When crew levels allow, workload will be reduced. The warning does not preclude crews exceeding 16 sectors when called from standby in the crewing window.

## OPS - POSITIONING

### Air positioning (reference: NAO 2019)
Usually planned on easyJet flights. Unless specified by crewing, due to the late booking of the flight, all crew positioning by air should have a confirmed seat. Travel in the cabin, as a normal passenger. Pilots will not be positioned by air of any duration prior to operating a flight duty on the same day, when planned at publication. If called from standby or a late-notice change, positioning before operating is permitted, however be mindful of fatigue threat.

### Ground positioning (reference: NAO 2019)
Ground positioning in France is generally limited to CDG - ORY trips. See the table below for the agreed travel times:

| Time of Day (LT) | Trip Duration |
|------------------|---------------|
| 00:00 - 04:00    | 1:15          |
| 04:01 - 21:59    | 2:00          |
| 22:00 - 23:59    | 1:15          |


At roster publication, ground positioning sectors prior to operating a flight duty shall not exceed 2 hours.

### Own Positioning
From roster publication to 48h prior to the commencement of the positioning sector, pilots may elect to make their own travel arrangements and claim back the cost via expenses, to a maximum of €78 per planned air sector. Note that the 48h window does not apply to positioning booked on other carriers. These may be cancelled and be eligible for own positioning expenses only if the ticket was not issued. There is no fixed timeframe for 3rd company tickets to be booked - own positioning should therefore be requested without delay.
If booked to position by air, but you choose to drive instead, a claim for milage should be filed with the equivalent milage of €78/sector, which may be less than the actual distance driven. See the expense matrix document for further details. Every time a pilot drives their own vehicle to position from home to the airport (other than home base), all time in excess of 1h30 will count for a sector to determine the max FDP(maximm of 2h30).
There is a form available for requesting OWNA (own way) positioning, see the connected portal homepage and look for the ‘forms’ link.
SNPL in continuously campaigning to reduce occurrences of positioning sectors immediately before a ight. The limitation on positioning before operating a ight, introduced in 2020, is an example of our achievement.

## OPS - DISRUPTION / SNC / REFUSAL
Document reference: NAO 2019

The Short Notice Change (SNC) window is a period of 72 hours preceding the commencement of a duty. This period is divided into two segments: 72-48 hours and 48-0 hours. Any pilot of any rank who accepts any ‘short notice change’ will be entitled to a ‘roster disruption’ payment of €66.16.

### Summary of SNC rules:
Pilots are entitled to 12 SNC refusals per calendar year, from 01 January to 31 December:
- 6 refusals to be used in the 72-48h window
- 6 refusals to be used in the 48-0h window
(These periods differ from the BALPA agreement)

Between 72 and 48 hours preceding the commencement of a duty:
- Changes with a difference of report time of -4 hours or more may be refused
- Changes with a difference of off-duty time of +4 hours or more may be refused

At or less than 48 hours preceding the commencement of a duty:
- Changes with a difference of report time of -2 hours or more may be refused
- Changes with a difference of off-duty time of +2 hours or more may be refused

Time reference used for the SNC Window is UTC. See Next Page for examples of what is and isn’t a SNC.

### Conditions

Roster changes must be accepted:

- Upon completion of a flying duty (on-blocks +30 minutes)
- Upon arrival after positioning (on-blocks +15 minutes)

There is no requirement to acknowledge a change when on days off or leave. Doing so could affect your ability to refuse the change. It could also affect the SNC payment. Mass disruption affecting the pilot or aircraft within 12 hours of the duty commencing suspends the SNC refusal.

### Example changes which qualify as an SNC (and may be refused as such):
* Changes within 72 hours to bring forward a standby appearing on the roster. [CLARIFY]
* Changes from a standby to a duty starting earlier than the initial standby start time + 90 minutes.
‣ For example, if the original duty is a LSBY (late standby) starting at 09:30z, and within 72 hours, the duty is changed to start before 11:00z qualifes as an SNC (09:30z + 90 minute call out).
* A duty changed to a standby within the SNC window, then changed or being called out to perform a new duty not within the +/-2 hours (or +/- 4 hours depending on the SNC window or 0-48 or 48-72 hours) of the originally rostered duty (or last accepted duty if this is different to published roster):
‣ Duty between 05:00z and 11:00z. Between 72 and 48 hours, changed to a ESBY then called out to perform a duty 10:00z/20:00z. As new duty not within +/- 4 hours of original duty, this qualifes as a SNC.
‣ Duty between 05:00z and 11:00z. Within 48 hours, changed to a ESBY then called out to perform a duty between 08:00z and 16:00z. As new duty not within +/- 2 hours of original duty, this qualifes as a SNC.
* Changes to add a night stop to a duty within the SNC window, regardless of the times of the new duty period.
‣ Flight duty 12:00z-22:00z. Changed to a new duty 12:00z-22:00z including a night stop. May be refused as a night stop has been added and qualifes as a SNC.

* Changes from a standby to a night stop where the duties within the following 48 hours are changed by +/- 2 hours (or within the following 48-72 hours are changed within +/- 4 hours).
‣ LSBY, next day flight duty 14:00z to 22:00z, called out from LSBY for positioning out + night stop, next day’s duty + positioning back 11:30z to 22:00z: out-of-base duty on day 2 starts more than 2 hours before initial in-base duty and qualifes as a SNC.

### Example changes which do not qualify as a SNC (and may not be refused as such):
* Changes from a standby to a duty which could have been assigned on the day, within the standby callout window.
‣ ESBY starting at 03:30z. A duty starting after 05:00z may be assigned regardless of Time of finish (achievable within FTL rules as if called out on the day of operation) and does not qualify as a SNC.
* Changes from a standby to a night stop where the duties within the following 48 hours are not changed by +/- 2 hours (or within the following 48-72 hours are not changed within +/4 hours).
‣ LSBY, next day flight duty 14:00z/22:00z. Called out from LSBY for positioning out + night stop, next day’s duty + positioning back 13:00z/23:00z. Out-of-base duty on day 2 starts less than 2 hours before initial in-base duty and does not qualify as a SNC.

Once a SNC is refused then any subsequently rostered duty on that day must stay within a two-hour period (if refused during the 48-hour window) or four-hour period (if refused during the 72-48 hour window) of the originally rostered duty (or last accepted duty if this is different to published roster).

The SNPL negotiated the extended SNC window, and increase in refusals, as part of the 2019 NAO which took effect at the end of December 2019. This is just a part of the wider project to increase roster stability and reduce fatigue.

## OPS - CONTACTING ICC
As a general rule always be polite and remember that, like us, ICC officers do what they can to run a smooth operation with the limited tools they have. By passing messages regarding FTL and absence clearly and concisely, the crewing officers are best placed to find solution. The following examples are what ICC expects to hear when you call them, no more no less. Crewing officers do not need to know, nor should they ask about the reason why you need to make the change.

### Following your statement below, you only need to wish them a pleasant shift and say goodbye.
#### By Phone:

## LVE - GENERAL
This section explains the multitude of methods we have to get some time off work.

LVE - annual holiday is bid for once a year in December for the period April to March of the following years, in two phases, which are explained below.
W/DO - on some AT patterns, FFR, or when booking leave in your reserve period, days off are automatically attached to the period of leave, subject to conditions.
GDO - on some AT patterns, FFR, a number of bookable guaranteed days off are available subject to certain conditions.

As a general rule, all LVE / GDO days must be booked no later than the 10th, two months before the effective month. For example, LVE booking for June closes on 11 April. For more information about the entire process, see the: Leave Hub on connected.easyjet.com

### Swapping Leave

It is possible to swap leave days directly with a colleague, by contacting the leave management team: leave.management@easyjet.com. We strongly recommend you do not try to swap the leave in eCrew as doing so may lead to leave being lost due to changes in pilot availability.

## LVE - ENTITLEMENTS
Annual LVE entitlement (reference: NAO 2014):
* 27 days on Fixed Pattern / 5354
* 30 days on Flexible Roster / FFR

Applicable from 1 April 2025 (reference: NAO 2024):
* 30 days on Fixed Pattern / 5354
* 35 days on Flexible Roster / FFR
* See LIFE - Alternate Time section for leave allowance in part time patterns

Loyalty Leave Days (reference: NAO 2018):
After 15 years service, pilots on a full time contract benefit from additional loyalty LVE days (pilot must have 10 years or more of time in France regardless of contract type but excluding sabbatical years, and be on full time contract):
* From 15 years of service: 1 additional day
* From 20 years of service: 2 additional days

## LVE - BIDDING
### Bidding System
Pilots may place up to 20 bids for leave. The bids are considered and granted based on the number of points a pilot has accrued in the previous leave year. Points are accrued by booking leave and each day booked in a given year will accumulate points for the following year's ranking. Higher demand days (christmas, easter etc) will carry a higher point penalty. The pilot with the lowest number of points accumulated in year will have the highest ranking (and greater chance of bid success) the following year.

SNPL has negotiated additional point modifiers, to comply with French legislation:
* 35 points are deducted per year of service in the company
* 50 points are deducted per child between 3 and 17 years of age. Please confirm your entitlement with your PSO before bidding commences.
* The point deductions above (for years of service and per child) are not applicable to French Pilot Trainers.
* 100 points are deducted if you have a dependant with a recognised disability / impairment. You must inform easyJet that this applies before the leave bid commences.

### Summer Leave
From the 1st of may till the 31st of October a Pilot is entitled to have 12 consecutive days off work, for example: 5 LVE and 7 D/O. In order to qualify for the summer leave guarantee you will need bid for it:
* Make as many Specific bids in this period as you like, e.g. 8 days from 11/08. Leave awarded will be at x 5 points
* You must follow this up with a non-specific bid for the summer period starting anywhere in the period 01/05 – 31/10. If you are 5354 you need to bid for 5 days, if you are FRV you need to bid for 6 days. It is recommended to make this the 20th (last) bid.
* If we are unable to grant your specific choices we will grant 1 period of 12 days between 1st May – 31st October, providing you have made the bid for it as above. Leave days awarded will in this case will be at x 2 points.
If you followed the above process but were not successful in obtaining the 12 days free from duty, please contact your base management and copy us into your email.

## LVE - OPEN PHASE
After the bidding results have been published and leave as been allocated, any remaining leave is released to the eCrew Vacation Bidding system, in January. The release is progressive across the network, with the dates being published by NTC. As pilots modify their leave bookings and establishment fine tunes pilot availability, leave can become available throughout the year. The open phase generally closes at the end of October to allow the next bidding process to commence. Any alterations to leave for the current year need to be made through your PSO.

## LVE - ALLOCATED LEAVE
Make sure to book all your leave before the leave department Auto Allocate them. Note that auto allocated leave is allocated at points value of x 10 the daily points value which could significantly increase your overall points and ranking for the next years leave bid.

ALVE (auto-allocated Leave) attract WDO (wrap days off) like LVE Days.

## LVE - W/DO WRAP DAYS OFF
[Definition: W/DO are days off that wrap around a leave booking. They adjust depending on how many consecutive leave days were taken and which roster pattern you are on].

For this FFR (flexi roster), AT50, AT75, Reserve Period (document reference: NAO 2014)
Wrap days (W/DO) are D/O applied either side of a block of leave days. They form part of the monthly D/O entitlement and will not create extra days off in a month.

|  consecutive leave days booked | WDO Requirement          				|
|-----|-----------------------------------------|
| 1   | 0 WDO                    				|
| 2-3 | 1 WDO before & after     				|
| 4   | 2 WDO before & after     				|
| 5-7 | 3 WDO before & after (see note 1)		|
| 8+  | 4 WDO before & after (see note 1)    	|

(note 1: AT50 is capped at 2 WDO before and after LVE. The total number of days off (D/O, GDO and WDO) in any 14 day on period may not exceed 5.)

### How are wraps assigned?

Wrap days off will only be assigned to the first block of LVE booked in any calendar month (or reserve period if Fixed Pattern).
The first block is identified by using the date and time that the booking was made. In the event that more than one booking was made on the same date and time then bid priority will be used to identify which block gets WDO (the highest bid priority getting the WDO), where the two bookings were made in the open phase at the exact same time then the date of the first booking will be used (i.e. that which is closest to the 1st of the month).
The only instance where more than one set of WDO can be granted in the same month is in FFR where there are two blocks of 5-7 LVE days in a calendar month booked in such a way that with WDO they are a period of continuous absence, in which instance both LVE bookings will be eligible for WDO.
Important: continuous means the WDO are adjacent, GDO can not be used.

WWW[LLLLL](block1)WWW/WWW[LLLLL](block 2)WWW

### Additional Conditions
* Where leave spans 2 months (30/01 - 02/02) the first day of leave shall define the applicable month for the calculation of wrap days.
* Wrap days off (WD/O) are only associated with LVE bookings. If LVE is removed, any wraps associated with this LVE may also be removed.

## LVE - GDO
For those on FFR (flexi roster) or part time such as AT50, AT75, AT90. Document reference NAO2014 - NAO2017.

Guaranteed days off (GDO) form part of the monthly normal day-off entitlement. Their purpose is to guarantee a D/O prior to roster publication and will not create additional D/O.

### Entitlement
* A maximum of 24 GDO may be booked in a calendar year, subject to availability
* A maximum of 1 weekend (Saturday / Sunday) may be booked in a calendar month
* A minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 consecutive GDO may be booked (On FFR, 3 single GDOs may
* GDOs may be booked directly adjacent to other off-roster codes such as LVE, ULV, W/DO
* Booked GDOs may leave a single working day, if it is subsequently filled by a W/DO

## LVE - UNPAID LEAVE
### Sabbatical Leave
For legal context in French visit this website: https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F2381
The purpose of sabbatical leave is to allow eligible employees, subject to the needs of the business, to take an unpaid break from work and return to employment at the end of the break period. The break may be for study, child care, personal development or any other similar pursuits for a period of between 6 - 11 months. The benefit to the employee of leaving through the sabbatical leave option is that, at the end of the period, they will be entitled to return to their previous job or an equivalent one. To benefit from this leave, it is required to have a minimum service of 3 years within the company and to be able to justify having worked for six years, please see the full policy for more details. Sabbatical is capped at 2FTE (Full Time Equivalent) per rank in France.

### Part-Time or Unpaid Leave for Creating or Taking over a Company
For legal context in French visit this website: https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F2382
After 2 years working at easyJet you can request up to 1 year of part time, or unpaid leave when you take-over or create your own company. This may be extended to two years. You must give at least two months notice. Company creation sabbatical is capped at 0,5% FTE (Full Time Equivalent) per rank in France. To apply for time off to create a company, proceed as follows: Send a documented request by registered mail with: activity, date of start, duration (max 12 months renewable once with 3 month notice by registered mail).

Easyjet checks if it fits within the allowable FTE for business creation:
* 0.5% of French FTE in rank and overall 2% of French FTE in rank on sabbatical

Easyjet will advise if the requirement is met:
* If yes, then the start date should be within 6 months
* If no, then the request is denied

### Who do I notify of my will to get and how ?
Scan your signed letter requesting the sabbatical, send it to your PSO and line manager, copying in HRFrance@easyjet.com. HR will respond within 30 days (if no answer after 30 days, the sabbatical leave is considered as granted by law).

### Unpaid Leave on the Roster
Unpaid leave can be organised on an ad-hoc basis, pre and post roster publication, through the relevant form on the Connected Portal or through your PSO.

## LVE - PARENTAL
Applies to: PILOTS WITH CHILDREN UP TO 6 YEARS OLD

The following describes what codes will appear on your roster and which options you will have. Note that you need to inform the company of the expected birth date, with at least a month's notice. Note that specific rules exist for child adoption.

### Birth Leave (PTRN)
3 days off roster, paid by easyJet, are granted for the birth of a child.

### Paternity Leave Unpaid (PTRU)
After the child’s birth, the employed parent is entitled to paternity leave of 25 calendar days (or 32 in case of multiple births). PTRU is unpaid but an allowance may be paid by the CPAM under certain conditions, see this link for more information:
https://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/droit-du-travail/les-absences-pour-maladie-et-conges-pour-evenements-familiaux/article/le-conge-de-paternite-et-d-accueil-de-l-enfant-naissances-intervenues-a-compter

### PTRU consists of two periods:
* The first mandatory period of 4 consecutive days immediately following the third day of PTRN
* The second period of up to 21 days (28 days for multiple births). These can be placed at employee’s convenience and divided into a maximum of two blocks, the shortest being at least 5 days. Any of these blocks must be requested with minimum one month notice and must begin within 6 months following the birth (though this can be extended in exceptional circumstances).

It is possible to request in advance without knowing the exact date of birth, more than 4 days of PTRU following the third PTRN Those days are taken from the second period quota and also need one month's notice.

Also, an extension of the initial period of 4 days of paternity and childcare leave is provided for, at the employee's request, in the event of immediate hospitalisation of the child after birth, throughout the period of hospitalisation and for a maximum period of 30 days.

Depending on the birth date your roster will be reorganised according to the following rules :
* If PRTN goes into D/O, it is then interrupted to start again on next day ON
* If PTRN or PTRU infringes LVE, LVE is re-credited or placed after PTRN + PTRU period (employee choice)
* If PTRU falls into a period of D/O, those are not re-credited.

### Parental Leave (PALV) (reference: NAO 2018)

In accordance with article L1225-47 of the Labour Code, any employee having one year’s service at the birth of his child or at the arrival of an adopted child is entitled to either:
* a period of (unpaid) parental leave during which their contract is suspended, or to
* a reduction in their working hours, with a minimum of 16 hours
If you are unsure of which pattern you would like, you may initially request for 6 months duration and then modify your choice. Though this is not written into the agreements, it is considered "good practice” on easyJet’s part.
The parental leave and the part time period of activity are initially granted for a maximum duration of one year but can be extended, and end when the child reaches 6 years of age. Parental Leave is available solely in accordance with the French legal modalities and conditions, with the exception of:
* Max duration extended up to 6th birthday of the child in return for ending fractional PALV
and
* For planning avoidance of disruption purposes, any parental leave will be subject to 3 month notice for initial request and 2 month for renewal
* AT7/7 AT50 and AT75 are available.
* A pilot upgrading to command will be able to recover his/her parental leave following 6 months of consolidation after his/her final line check.
As part of NAO 2018, SNPL negotiated the extension of parental part-time and leave until the child’s 6th birthday. Additional part-time patterns, such as 7/7, were also made available.
The company will respect the QVT (Well-being at work) negotiation and the commitment made in July 2017 to create more parental leave options for parents of children up to the child's age of six. However it won’t be possible to take a block every year, just once.

## LVE - OTHER
### Leave for Family Events
Pilots are entitled to the following additional paid days off taken on the date of the event:
* 3 days for each birth / adoption of a child (see LVE - PARENTAL)
* 12 days for the death of a child ( can be more depending on the age of the child)
* 3 days for the death of the spouse or partner, parent, sibling, partner’s parent
* 1 day for the wedding of a child
* 5 days for the announcement of a child’s handicap, cancer or chronicle pathology needing therapeutical learning
* 3 days per year for sickness of a child with a sick note ( up to 5 days in case of handicap)
For the following event, the days off may be taken within 15 days of the event:
* 4 days to get married and/or PACS (each event gives 4 days)

### Leave for Family Solidarity or Sickness
In accordance with the French Labour Code, every employee is entitled to unpaid leave or, a reduction in working hours, to care for family members and/or children who are ill. The requirements and allowable duration vary according to the gravity of the condition. Further information, and the correct procedure to follow in order to obtain unpaid leave, is available at the following websites, in French:
* General cases of serious family sickness - https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/N510 [TO-DO: UPDATE LINK]
* Sickness of a Child under 16 (Roster code "CSL" on AIMS)

Under certain conditions, employees can take some leave to take care of a sick child. The employee is eligible for 3 days of absence per year increased to 5 if the child concerned is less than one year old; or if the employee has parental responsibility for 3 children who are under 16 years old.

http://www.caf.fr/aides-et-services/s-informer-sur-les-aides/petite-enfance/l-allocationjournaliere-de-presence-parentale-ajpp-12

If you require further assistance with solidarity or sickness leave, you can contact any SNPL representative.

## LIFE - ROSTER PATTERNS

A reduced 4-4 fixed pattern roster is introduced, see LIFE - Alternate Time.

### FFR (French Flexible Roster)

The French Flexible Roster consists of a random roster with the following conditions:
- 144 D/O per calendar year (1 Jan to 31 Dec)
- 12 D/O minimum per calendar month, except for February (11 D/O)

- Instances of 2 D/O followed by 5 duty days shall be reduced (Note: If you find a 2 off / 5 on pattern or single day off on your roster, file a Fatigue Mitigation Request and be vigilant of any fatigue threat on the day of operation.)

**From 1 April 2025: The pattern attracts 146 D/O per year, minimum 12 each month. The annual LVE allocation is 35 days.**

### Pattern Choice

Every September/October, pilots may elect to change pattern during the lifestyle bidding. The pattern change is effective for the entire subsequent leave year: 1 April - 31 March. For more detail about leave allowances, see LVE - Entitlements.

## LIFE - PREFERENCES / PBS
Every month, from the 13th to the 22nd, pilots have the possibility to express preferences for the month after next. For example, preferences for March are placed between 13 and 22 January.

For issues or questions about the Preferential Bidding System (PBS), contact: pilotpreferencesupport@easyjet.com

For pilots on a fixed pattern: The introduction of preferences removes the default early-late alternation of the fixed pattern, however pilots on a fixed pattern may elect to retain the alternation through preferences. Roster preferences were negotiated in the 2016 NAO, and were introduced at all French bases in April 2018 following a ballot by base & rank of all concerned pilots.

## LIFE - ALTERNATE TIME
Document reference NAO2017 / NAO 2024 / Alternate time Agreement
Every October, pilots may elect to change pattern during the lifestyle bidding. The part-time change is effective from the commencement of subsequent leave year: 1st April, for the duration specified in the request. A second bid runs in April, with pattern change on 1st October. Changes to patterns will only be accepted if the base FTE allows. Conflicting leave will not be automatically accommodated.

### Allocation Process
A pilot may bid for alternate time as per the criteria below:

# Alternate Time Management

| Category | Alternate Time List 1 | Alternate Time List 2 |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Allocation | 70% of alternate time FTE | 30% of alternate time FTE |
| Type | Permanent alternate time | Short alternate time 1 or 2 years |
| Rank/Role | CPT / FO | CPT / FO |
| Requirements | • Minimum age 50 on 1st April<br>• Minimum of 10 years flying for EZY<br>• Minimum of 5 years in rank<br>• Minimum of 3 years in base | • Minimum of 2 years in rank<br>• Minimum of 2 years in base<br>• Must decide 1 or 2 years on application |
| Priority | DOJ gives position on the list | DOJ gives position on the list |
| Reapplication | If 2 pilots reapply at the same time, DOJ gives priority | Can bid for list 2 |
| Bid Eligibility | Can bid for list 2 | Cannot bid for list 1 |
**Additional Notes:**
If, after granting all Alternate Time strictly following the above process, there is residual FTE availability in base and rank, then 1-year Alternate Time can be granted despite conditions in rank or base not being met.
The quota of year-round alternate time is 20% FTE per base/rank.
Pilots who do not meet the requirements for the lists may still bid, but the award of alternate time will be subject to the FTE and operational requirements of the base. AT 4-4 is subject to a separate quota of 25% FTE per base/rank in 2025, with no minimum time in base. The bid to join AT 4-4 is for an unlimited period of time. A pilot on AT 4-4 may bid to change to another pattern at any bidding cycle. Should the number of applicants exceed the available number of places, DOJ will be used to determine the successful candidates.

### For PILOTS OVER 50 YEARS AGE - Addendum Alternate Time
Pre-retirement: The following patterns are available for pre-retirement: AT50M, AT75, AT14/14 and AT7/7 The notice period for requesting pre-retirement is 6 months, though we recommend at least 12, and you must inform the company by registered letter. The pensionable alternate contracts will only be available as a form of pre-retirement to those over 50 years of age who have met the CRPN eligibility, as laid in the information notice issued by CRPN dated December 2011. There is no FTE quota for pre-retirement part-time.

Note that confirmed tickets bought as such benefit from the EU261 protection. However, standby tickets that are later confirmed do not benefit from these protections. easyJet flight crew benefit from Speedy Boarding, and may take a large cabin bag, by presenting their ID at the gate. If travelling with others on the same booking, the entire group benefits from these privileges. More information is also available on the Connected Portal > Staff Travel.

## LIFE - FATIGUE
### Fatigue Mitigation
Fatigue is real and should not be underestimated! This section describes the tools we have to mitigate fatigue. Remember that the prevention & mitigation of fatigue is your responsibility as flight crew. Use the tools available to you and fly safe … and awake!

## FTL - Discretion
### Controlled Rest (document reference: OMA 8.3.9.1)
Flight Deck crew members have the ability to take controlled rest in accordance with OMA 8.3.9.1 (Controlled Rest on the Flight Deck). A Fatigue Report Form must be completed for every instance of controlled rest. Note: A brief report stating the length of the rest is sufficient. Write NIL on the other columns unless other information is pertinent.

### Fatigue Reporting
It is vital that you to fill in a Fatigue Report Form via Safety Net for every fatiguing situation you encounter as this is the only means to track fatigue. We can not challenge fatigue with the company unless there is a paper trail.

### Future Roster Vs General Fatigue
The company is seeing an increasing number of crew raising General Concerns instead of Future Fatigue Mitigation Requests (FMR). FMRs are prioritised, and therefore using the incorrect descriptor may lead to the report not being actioned proactively.
As a reminder:
- General Concerns: Raise a retrospective issue that did not involve a fatigued absence.
- Fatigue Mitigation Requests: Request a review of a forthcoming roster sequence in order to assess the roster related fatigue potential.

### Hotel Accommodation
On request, pilots will be provided with a hotel room at the airport if they have been on duty in excess of 14 hours or if commander’s discretion exceeds 1 hour based on Table I.3

### FDP Reduction / Increased Rest Period
[TO-DO: CHECK REF] AMC1 ORO.FTL.2015(f)(2) Flight Duty Period (FDP) states: In case of unforeseen circumstances which could lead to severe fatigue, the commander shall reduce the actual flight duty period and/or increase the rest period in order to eliminate any detrimental effect on flight safety.
This is a very powerful tool, which may be used to combat fatigue for a crew during periods of disruption. A CDR must be filed if the commander chooses to reduce FDP or increase the rest period.

More reading here: [05 2017 Increased Rest](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KNmukMpJyM3V3EOOe36KFZU-rcKJy-RC/view)

### Fatigue Offload / Absence
If you become fatigued due to your roster, you can choose to offload yourself or not operate.
1. Inform Crewing by telephone, at least 90 minutes before report, or ACARS if already on duty
2. Complete a Fatigue report form on Safetynet within 48h of the event
Note that, after calling fatigued during a duty, you will be offloaded at the end of the sector and can no longer operate/position until after a rest period. You may only call fatigued for two consecutive days. More information about the fatigue absence process is available in the FRMS manual.

### Unfit
Unfit is used where you are not fit to operate due to external factors, not caused by your roster, such as noisy neighbours, etc. The process for reporting UNFT is the same as reporting roster related fatigue:
1. Crew are required to submit a Fatigue Report Form to FRMS, but only for the purposes of analysis and trending
2. Only single day claims can be made and UNFT is paid basic salary
3. UNFT is not suitable for longer term conditions which will continue to be managed locally with the aim of providing as much support as possible for the crew
4. FRMS will not refer UNFT claims and it is only with the appreciation of the full context that your Base Captain will call for a welfare meeting* or more simply have a welfare chat with the concerned crew.
We recommend that you send a courtesy email to your base captain with a brief summary of your unfit report.

### FRMS Philosophy (Written by one of our Base Captains)
First of all the fatigue system is a sub part of the safety management system. The safety management system measures the safety level and makes recommendations to the stakeholders in the company. Actions are taken and we measure the safety level. This closed loop feedback system, makes easyJet a learning Organisation based on evidence, based on safety reports where the fatigue reports as the ASR's make part of it. For me, how we manage safety, easyJet is the most developed operator that I have ever seen. Something we can all be proud of. The Just Culture, is the environment whereby we all are invited to report a safety related event without being punished for it. When a pilot reports fatigue, it is a safety event that sits in our Just culture. No pilot will be punished for reporting fatigued, that includes career progression from FO to Captain. Base Captains, looking after the well-being of their pilots and in their duty of care for their pilots, they can occasionally ask a pilot if he is all right. Do not hesitate to offload yourself if you consider yourself unfit. You all have a huge responsibility on the line and you are the last ones in the 'chain' to prevent the worst.

## LIFE - RETIREMENT
Applicable to: PILOTS OVER 60 YEARS AGE
If you are getting close to 60 you might start thinking about retirement, for various personal reasons. Feel free to get in touch with us, so we can help you understand how the unemployment system in France could interact with your pensions. The principle is that you might improve your revenues by combining unemployment and pension for a few years, until final retirement.
### Basic rule
Pensions: depending on an individual’s career, are:
* French State pension, available from 62 years old with reduced benefits and 67 with full benefits
* CRPN, available from 50 years old with high deduction and 55 with lower or no deduction and 60 with no deduction,
* Third country pensions (if you have been flying in other countries: UK, Spain, Italy etc): if you worked in a different field as engineer, salesman you probably have another private pension as AGIRC-ARRCO etc.
* Private saving funds that you hold with your bank or insurance company: PERP…

Chômage, also called Pôle emploi, is the unemployment service in France. You are paid 57% of your average gross salary, capped at approx. €7600, from which you contribute 9.7% in social charges. The calculation of the average salary is based on previous 2 years salaries if below 53 or 3 years salaries if 53 and above.
Below 57, payments decrease from the 7th month by 30%. No decrease is applied above 57.

### Specificities for France
In France, pilots can fly up to 65 years old. But from 60, they need to declare to their employer their intention to continue flying, 3 months at least before anniversary date, every year. According to the “accord de génération” you should receive a reminder letter from the company 4 months before the due date. When you decide to stop flying, the company should offer a ground position if available, and if declined by the employee or not available, you are dismissed. In this specific case, an indemnity is paid by easyJet. It is called: Indemnité exclusive de départ, calculated based upon seniority in the company:

Average monthly salary is the best of:
* 12 months average calculation including bonuses
* 3 months average calculation excluding bonuses
Indemnity:
‣ Less than 10 years service: 1/10th of monthly salary per year of service.
‣ 10 years of service or more: 1/10th of monthly salary per year of service + 1/15th per
year beyond 10 years.
example: 15 years service = 15×1/10 + 5 1/15 = 1,83 calculated average monthly salary.
A top up is paid according following table: New for 2020!
* Retirement at 60: legal indemnity + 5 months
* Retirement at 61: legal indemnity + 4 months
* Retirement at 62: legal indemnity + 3 months
* Retirement at 63: legal indemnity + 2 months
* Retirement at 64: legal indemnity + 1 month
This top up will create “carence” for unemployment payments, meaning they will be postponed up to 150 days.

### Timeline
To summarise, your benefits depend on your age:
Above 53: 22 months of unemployment (6 months at 57% of your gross, the rest with 30% reduction)
Above 55: 27 months of unemployment (6 months at 57% of your gross, the rest with 30% reduction)
Above 57: 27 months of unemployment with no reduction.
From 60 (or from 55 in certain cases): CRPN pension with no reduction
From 62: If still perceiving unemployment payments at 62 or beyond, payments having being perceived a minimum of 12 months, and under a few requirements, extension of your payments until the date of your full state pension (max 67). Requirements for extension : 62 years and 100 trimesters and 12 years of contributions to Social Security with at last 1 full year within last 5.

### Between 62 and 67
State pension payments begin, and Unemployment payments stop (A discussion is underway to raise the state pension threshold to 64).
When you will be gone for your last trip, your spouse will receive the “pension de reversion” (50% of state pension and 60% of CRPN). The amount is calculated based on the duration of your marriage.
#### Summary
Let’s see how this works. First you need to work out a few dates according your career. When do you reach the age for the FULL State Pension? (this determines the length of unemployment payments) and when do you reach the age for the FULL CRPN Pension (without deduction)?

At the moment it is either 60 years or the sum of (AGE+YEARS OF SERVICE) = 80, with minimum age 55 or minimum 30 years of service (example: 58 years old + 22 years of service = 80). You can count the years of service in Europe regardless of the contributions made into CRPN.

### Examples
Jean-François:
* Started flying at 23
* 30 years of contributions into CRPN, so is able to receive CRPN from 53 with no reduction
* Retires at 62
* CRPN pension fund: 9000€ (which could be increased if he continues flying)
* Receives the Indemnité exclusive de départ and the top up.
* He could receive the chômage until 64 but would not earn more than receiving only CRPN
At 64, he gets the state pension of 1500€ on top of the CRPN 9000€ = 10500€

Marie-Celeste:
* She gets the Indemnité exclusive de départ and the top up
* From 60, she receives the CRPN pension: 5000€ gross, 4500€ net.
* No deduction as she complies with one of the requirements (age 60).
* If she kept flying, the CRPN pension would keep increasing, but she believes she has enough to live with.
* She registers at Pole Emploi (unemployment office) and receives the chômage.
* After a few months of Carence (due to the supra legal indemnities), she starts receiving the chômage for 27 months, reduced by 75% of the net payment from CRPN (4500 net, hence 3375€ deduction).
* She now receives : 6500€ from chômage - 3375€ deduction + 4500 € from CRPN = 7625€ net.
* Because she still receives chômage at 62, it is extended until her age of full state pension: 67 years old.
* From 67, she then receives CRPN 4500€ net + State pension 1200€ net = 5700€ net total.

### Additional Rules
The CRPN pension increases with contributions. In order to do so, you need to work as a pilot.
When you decide to draw your CRPN pension, the pension is frozen. Unemployment payments do not contribute to CRPN.
You can draw a “CRPN pension with no deduction” but it will be lower than the CRPN pension you will receive later if you continue flying.
When unemployed and receiving unemployment payments, you continue to contribute to your state pension.
When entitled to a CRPN pension, the unemployment payments will be lowered even if the CRPN pension is not taken yet (In that case the state does not pay for what should be paid by your private pension, that makes sense. But you have no reason not to take the CRPN).
Deduction made to the unemployment payments when you have CRPN payments:
- 50% of your gross CRPN payment below 60 years old
- 75% above 60

If still receiving the unemployment payments at 62, they are extended until the age of the full state pension.
On a full time captain salary, the chômage is at the maximum due to the cap of around 6500€ net.
More information about the pension entitlements is available in the PAY - Pension section.

## SICK - GENERAL
Document reference: Flight operations protocol manual 4.1 and easyJet's "Our people policies wellness and absence")

**Not feeling well? Don’t go flying! Remember, where there is doubt, there is no doubt.**

### How to report sick for a duty
1. Inform Crewing that you are unable to operate, via eCrew or by telephone. Except in an emergency, you must inform crewing at least 90 minutes before report time.
2. Obtain a sickness certificate “arrêt de travail” from your doctor. This certificate must be dated the same day as your first day of sickness.
3. Send a digital copy of the third page of your “arrêt de travail” certificate to your BSA within 48h of you reporting sick. The hard copy should be mailed or hand delivered when you next go to work
4. Send the first two pages of the sickness certificate to your Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie within 48h of you reporting sick. Some doctors may do this electronically fo you.

### Doctor unavailable / I can’t leave home
Some towns have evening/weekend walk-in clinics (maison médicale de garde) and videoconsultations are available on apps and websites such as Qare. If none are available or if you are too sick to leave home contact SOS médecins: 3624 (from a french phone) and they will arrange for a consultation.

### Sickness outside France
You must always provide a certificate from a doctor for any sickness, even if you are outside France. A note stating that you are “unfit to perform your duties from (date) to (date)” should be sufficient for the company. We also recommend obtaining a more detailed medical description for the CPAM, should they request justification. The same notification periods apply as if you were in France.

### Accident or injury at work
If you fall sick, have an accident or are injured while at work, or commuting to/from work, you must file an Accident de Travail:
1. Notify the company, via your PSO or BSA, that you have had an accident de travail
2. Obtain and complete the “accident de travail” certificate in the crew room. If you are not at the crew room, this certificate should be emailed to you
3. Obtain a sickness certificate “accident de travail” from your doctor or the attending doctor
4. Send a digital copy of the third page of your “accident de travail” certificate to your BSA.

### Return to work
If you have an arrêt maladie or accident de travail, you may return to work after the “arrêt de travail” has ended. You may not return to work early.

## SICK - MUTUELLE
Document reference: Guide santé easyJet au sol et PNT)

Medical costs in France are covered, up to certain limits, by the CPAM. You usually pay for your treatment, then get refunded by bank transfer. For medical costs above the CPAM limits, as well as prescription medicine, tests, dental treatments, glasses, etc, a secondary top-up cover exists: the mutuelle. Follow [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-3HJH7fEzIOiGN3GgeQ6L22ss8TMbYLP) for internal documents.
easyJet subscribes a mutuelle for all flight crew through CPMS. The cost is split between the company and the employee. You may increase your coverage policy, or include your family & dependants, but the additional cost is yours. Pricing information is sent by email every year in October.
Your inscription to CPMS will take place when you sign your French contract. You may modify your cover, under certain conditions, every October.
You may only opt out of the easyJet mutuelle under the following conditions:
* Employee on Fixed Term Contract (FTC) lasting less than 12 months
* Employee on FTC lasting at least 12 months who is already covered individually
* Employee covered by CMU-C
* Employee affiliated to a mandatory family policy of a partner, which provides at least equivalent cover. Proof of cover must be provided annually.

## SICK - MINIMUM MONTHLY SALARY (SMMG)
Document reference: Conflict resolution on remuneration)

When sick, you will receive your basic salary immediately for all sickness days, and for the first 3 calendar months after the incident, followed by 50% basic salary for a further three months.
Additionally, every sickness day will be paid 1 nominal sector for the first 3 calendar months, followed by 0.5 nominal sector for a further three months.
This is called the “Salaire Mensuel Minimum Garanti” (SMMG) or minimum monthly wage.
Applicable roster codes: SICK, SIDO (sick on a D/O), LTS (Long Term Sick), SIRP (Sick on Report) and SLN (Sick Late Notice)
See PAY - PAYSLIPS for more information
[Link to agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lI6IXjiD1Os5E5_Qi-bcuUcYxCkzYtij/view)

## SICK - LONG TERM SICKNESS
Long term sickness, in this guide, applies to any period of sickness exceeding 30 days.

### MED.A.020 decrease in medical fitness
Licence holders shall not exercise the privileges of their licences and related ratings or certificates at any time when they:
* are aware of any decrease in their medical fitness that might render them unable to safely exercise those privileges;
* take or use prescribed or non-prescribed medication that is likely to interfere with the safe exercise of the privileges of the applicable licence; or
* receive any medical, surgical or other treatment that is likely to interfere with flight safety

In addition, licence holders shall, without undue delay, seek aeromedical advice when they:
* have undergone a surgical operation or invasive procedure;
* have commenced the regular use of any medication;
* have suffered any significant personal injury involving capacity to function as a member of the flight crew;
* have been suffering from any significant illness involving incapacity to function as a member of the flight crew;
* are pregnant;
* have been admitted to hospital or medical clinic; or first require correcting lenses

After reporting any of the above issues to your AME, you will receive notification that your medical has been suspended.

### CPAM
CPAM - contact centre: 3646 (from France) / +33 8 11 70 36 46 (from abroad)
Your situation can be more complex than the average french worker, especially if commuting. We recommend asking for the “service des relations internationales” once you are connected.

### Medicine du Travail
You must visit the French company doctor after 30 days of sickness. The appointment is arranged by your base team.

### Medical Reports
We strongly advise that you keep paper and scanned copies of all the medical exams and reports, sickness notes, etc. as you will need to send them to medical authorities and the APPN. Take them with for all appointments. After a fracture, your AME or the Medicine du Travail will require a “consolidation certificate”.

### SNPL Assistance
In case of temporary or permanent loss of license, the SNPL can provide assistance to perform all the steps. The EOS cell (listening, guidance and support) is led by a pilot coordinator and an aeronautical doctor, also airline pilot, who will provide confidential support during the different stages. Contact: inaptevol@snplfalpa.org and provide your contact details and age.

### Pay during sickness
For standard sickness, salary will continue to be paid by easyJet.
* 100% basic for the month the sickness started and the next 3 months
* 50% basic for the following 3 months This is increased to 6 months for both brackets if the sickness is an "accident du travail”
If on Long Term Sick (LTS), maternity or paternity leave, beyond the period paid by easyJet (Maintien de salaire), the CPAM will pay the employee directly, provided that easyJet has sent an attestation to the CPAM. We strongly recommend you check with French payroll and the CPAM that the « attestation de salaire » has been sent in order to activate the payment.

For the first 3 years of each individual contract, the capital is capped at 35% of the values in the table above.
Over the age of 50, the permanent loss of licence decreases by 10% per year.
In case of temporary loss of licence followed by a permanent loss of licence, the payout sum is based on the date when the permanent loss of licence was decided, even if it is a consequence of the same sickness that caused a temporary loss of licence.

### Temporary Loss of Licence
Two different scenarios apply:

1. Sickness: Your salary will continue to be paid by easyJet:
* 100% basic for the month the sickness started and the next 3 months
* 50% basic for the following 3 months
2. Accident de travail: Salary is paid by easyJet at 100% basic for the first 6 months, then 50% for the following 6 months. (Total 12 months).

In addition to what easyJet pays, we have 2 temporary Loss of License covers:
1) easyJet Loss of Licence insurance As explained above, after 6 months of sickness, you can may request a monthly payment of 2% of your company LOL (Loss of License Cover), but this amount is deducted from your permanent LOL coverage. To make a claim, contact your base captain or PSO.
2) Company APPN cover
This is a separate cover for pilots up to 60 years of age, based on the following table:

| Rank      | Full Time | AT50   | AT50M  | AT75   | AT90   | AT7/7  | ATS    |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| CPT       | € 7000    | € 3500 | € 3500 | € 5250 | € 6300 | € 4256 | € 5544 |
| SFO / FO  | € 4000    | € 2000 | € 2000 | € 3000 | € 3600 | € 2432 | € 3168 |

You will have to notify the APPN of your sickness to receive the cover as follows:

#### For CPT, SFO and FO
20% from day 29 to day 91 - covering for the loss of sector pay
60% from day 92 to day 182 - to match the 50% salary payment from easyJet
100% from day 183 to day 1095 - where easyJet does not pay any salary
#### For SO
50% from day 92 to day 182
100% from 183rd to day 1095

The policy is jointly paid by the employee and easyJet, according to the tables here:

### Temporary Loss of Licence for pilots over 60
Employees over 60 years old will benefit of an equivalent amount of the contribution applicable to their rank, in order to subscribe to an individual insurance policy for one year. This contribution will be paid in one lump sum upon communication of the individual contract or APPN certificate.

### Personal APPN Cover

The APPN provides individual policies covering: Death, Permanent and Temporary loss of licence. You can subscribe to their policies, if under 45, by filling an application. For Temporary loss of licence, your personal APPN cover will be paid in addition to the easyJet cover, however the sum of both policies can not be greater than your salary. For Permanent loss of licence, your personal APPN cover will be paid in addition to the easyJet cover, without any limitation.

## SICK - DEATH IN SERVICE
easyJet provides an internal death in service insurance. As stated in your contract: “A lump sum payment will be made to the employee’s prenominated beneficiary on death whilst in the employment of easyJet of four times their annual basic salary”

[Defining Sector types and Sector Pay:

There are 4 types of sectors that can be flown: Short Sectors, Medium Sectors, Long Sectors and Extra-Long sectors that are defined by the great circle distance between the Airport pairs. See the table below:

	Type 		|	Great Circle Distance]	|		Multiplier
	------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
	Short 		|	< 400 nm 				|	0.8 * Nominal Sector
	Medium		|	400 nm to 1000 nm 		|	1.2 * Nominal Sector
	long 		|	1001 nm - 1500 nm 		|	1.5 * Nominal Sector
	Extra-Long	|	1501 nm or more 		|	2.5 * Nominal Sector

Each of these sector types have a multiplier:

Type 		|		Multiplier
------------|--------------------------
Short 		|	0.8 * Nominal Sector
Medium		|	1.2 * Nominal Sector
long 		|	1.5 * Nominal Sector
Extra-Long	|	2.5 * Nominal Sector

To find out the euro value of sector pay for a given sector flown on a roster (Airport A to Airport B):

1) Determine the sector type based on the great circle distance.

2) Find the appropriate multiplier for that sector type.

3) Multiply the multiplier by the Nominal Sector Pay according to rank (using the table below)

	Rank 		   |	Nominal Sector Pay
	---------------|-----------------------
	Captain 	   |    €41.56
	FO or SFO      |	€30.90
	Second Officer | 	Only paid for night stops, training duties etc

e.g. A captain flies from LYS (Lyon Airport) to BCN (Barcelona Airport). The greate circle distance is 296 nautical miles = Medium Sector = 0.8 multiplier. The calculation would be Nominal Sector pay for a captain (€41.56) * Multiplier (0.8) = €41.56 * 0.8 = €33.25]


This table shows the Sector Pay applicable for different ranks and sector lengths: [The type of sector is dependant on the great circle distance between the airports concerned, shown in nautical miles. The nominal is for reference, and the others show the name (e.g. short, medium etc) with a multiplication factor (e.g. .8 or 1.2) that gives the actual sector pay.]

| Range     | Nominal    | Short .8 (≤ 400 nm) | Medium 1.2 (401 - 1000 nm) | Long 1.5 (1001 - 1500 nm) | Extra Long 2.5 (≥ 1501 nm) |

Nominal sectors apply to night stops, training duties, airport duty, etc.

### Loyalty Bonus (reference: NAO 2019)
The loyalty bonus is paid on a monthly basis, as 1/12th of the annual loyalty bonus, due at the anniversary month. This means that the monthly payment of the loyalty bonus commences 12 months prior to the anniversary month. [This is a function of your time in the company (ancienneté) as per your joining data on a permanent contract, regardless of which country you were in previously, with any time on Flexi-Crew not counted. Copilots (Second Officers, First Officers and Second Officers) are paid a maximum loyalty bonus of 5% for over 3 years of service.  Captains' bonuses have different brackets of 2, 5 and 10 years]

Co-Pilots with 3 years = 5% of gross salary.
Captains with 2 years = 5% of gross, with 5 years of service paid at 10% and 15 years of service at 15%.

The monthly payment (fraction of annual payment) is adjusted to follow any changes in pay / rank progression. The loyalty bonus is not subject to the 10% reduction in basic salary following upgrade to captain.

### Intéressement
(Document reference: ACCORD INTERESSEMENT)
French operational bonus, based on performance in a Financial Year (01/10 to 30/09 of the year) and paid at the latest, on the last day of the 7th month following the end date of the reference tax year.

[This table shows the amounts due for a given target and a resulting percentage payment as a function of basic salary. EBITDAR = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Restructuring or Rent costs. CSAT = Customer Satisfaction Score, where a score above 53.7% achieves a Threshold payment of 0.09% and Target payment of 0.45%, with no CSAT score above this accruing any further payment. GLB = Green Light Boarding, where the threshold is 93.5% resulting in a payment of 0.11%, the target of 95.5% acheiving a payment of 0.55%, and above this figure does not accrue any further payment.]

|             | Threshold | Target | Stretch | % Annual Basic |
|-------------|-----------|--------|---------|----------------|
| EBITDAR     | 0,20 %    | 1,45 % | 4,50 %  | 4,50 %         |
| CSAT 53.7%  | 0,09 %    | 0,45 % | -       | 0,45 %         |
| GLB*        | 0,11 %    | 0,55 % | -       | 0,55 %         |
| TOTAL       | 0,40 %    | 2,45 % | 4,50 %  | 5,50 %         |
* If the PBT falls anywhere between Threshold and Stretch, then the percentage paid is related to the actual profitability achieved using straight-line calculations.
* Payment based on gross basic salary paid for the financial year, less any non-remunerated absences (except occupational accident, occupational disease, maternity leave, paternity leave or adoption leave).
* Payments are made via the PEE where you can cash it out and/or leave it blocked for 5 years to get tax discounts. You may combine both options.

### Performance Bonus (reference: NAO 2019)
Network bonus [aka performance bonus] for 2024 is paid in December and based on Headline PBT (Profit Before Tax) of easyjet's Financial Year 2024 (01/10/23 to 30/09/24).
If the PBT is £400 million - £453 million, pilots receive a Threshold Bonus of 0.86% of their gross salary.
If the PBT is £453 million - £670 million, pilots receive a Target Bonus of 4.3% of their gross salary.
If the PBT is above £670 million, pilots receive a Stretch Bonus of 8.6% of their gross basic salary.

### Participation
French legal requirement, the company payments are based on the profits made by the French official structure (around 20 people only). Payments are approximately €10-25 net. [TO-DO: Clarify]

### Free shares
Awarded at the company’s discretion only, usually in April following the end of the financial year. Usually up to 2 weeks basic salary, blocked for 3 years, capped at £3000. In the first two years following the shares award, easyJet pays an equivalent dividend through payroll. Beyond this, dividends are paid through the global nominee or Groupama PEE as applicable.

## PAY - PAYSLIPS
### General Knowledge
We receive 2 documents from payroll per month. The PAYSLIP edited by Ernst & Young (EY) and the Payslip Supplement from CVP (which lists the details of our variable activity). Both can be retrieved in Workday.
All operations in the upper part of the payslip determine your GROSS salary which is first submitted to social contributions (Charges sociales), then tax.
Operations on the lower part are NET and are not submitted to social contributions (Indemnité uniforme, SAYE or deduction of an advance payment). All elements of variable pay are reported on the following month (sector pay, leave, sickness…) except maternity, parental leave and sabbatical which are displayed on the current month. On the right side of the payslip, you will find a column with a detailed description of your previous month activity (INCIDENTS) which allows you to check if leave payments or sickness payments are correct.

[Definitions:
PAS = Prelevement a la Source = Income tax]

#### For pilots on full time contracts:
##### Basic Salary & Overtime
From August 2019 we introduced the display of overtime, for pilots on a Full Time contract only. Note, our full time contracts have always stated that we had 15 hours of overtime within our 90 hours flat rate.

[Example below from the top section of a payslip concerning the overtime payment structure. It shows the basic salary of 75 hours as we consider the last 15 to be overtime.]

| Éléments de paie                    | Base  | Taux     | A payer   | A déduire | Charges patronales |
|-------------------------------------|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Salaire de base                     | 75.00 | 74.1357  | 5 560.18  |           |                     |
| Heures mensuelles majorées 25%      | 15.00 | 92.6696  | 1 390.04  |           |                     |
| Sous total Salaire de base          | 90.00 |          | 6 950.22  |           |                     |

3 lines are displayed in order to reflect the overtime calculation. If you are not eligible to overtime tax deduction (for example, on Alternate Time), then one single line is displayed for basic salary.

[TO-DO: VERIFY CALCULATIONS]

##### For PILOTS ON AT50M, AT50, AT7/7, AT75, ATS2, AT90: Alternate Time Salary:
In the past, there used to be 2 methods of paying pilots on Alternate Time:
* Payment of a full time basic followed by a deduction on the next line. Eg: - 50% for AT50 or -25% for AT75.
* In certain cases (example: Therapeutical part time), you would only get credited a percentage of your basic (one single line).

In the present payroll system, all pilots have a single line with the basic calculated at the pro-rata of your AT:
| Éléments de paie | Base   | Taux    | A payer  | A déduire |
|------------------|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Salaire de base  | 113.75 | 75.2543 | 8 560.18 |           |

Note: Instead of displaying the pro rata of the 90h at rate full time, the base column shows a percentage of your AT compared to the legal 151,67 hours.

### Holiday Pay
Document reference: Conflict Resolution 2018
The way the company has been calculating our LVE has changed a few times over the years. You have most probably heard about the 1/10th discrepancies. From April 2018 (appearing from May 2018 on your payslip) we are using a new calculation, requested by the SNPL, and agreed with the company, which is the correct legal method, and is also generally calculated in favour of the pilots. The aim of the new system is to be compliant with French Law by paying the employee whatever is more beneficial for them between the legal 1/10th and the "maintien", forcing the company to run both calculations every month.
To summarise, the real "Dixième" [or 1/10th payment] "now replaces the former “complément au dixième”. The normal display is now:
* A deduction of 1/25th of monthly basic salary per day.
* A payment for the greater of the following:
	‣ “Maintien” which is 1/25th of monthly basic + 2,7 nominal sectors
	‣ “Dixième”: 1/250th of the previous year's income (PBT Bonus NOT included)

[The following is an example extract from a payslip concerning the dixieme payment:]
| Éléments                                      | Base  | Taux      | A payer  | A déduire |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Congés payés pris 21/09/19-22/09/19 (2 jours) | -2.00 | 226.6316  |   	   | 453.26    |
| Indemnité congés payés (2 jours)              |       |           | 684.01   |           |

Sometimes, the old display is still used:
* Repayment of the Basic salary + “complément indemnité congés payés”.
| Éléments                                      | Base  | Taux      | A payer  | A déduire |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Congés payés pris 020919-060919 (5 jours)     | -5.00 | 410.8884  |          | 2 054.44  |
| Indemnité congés payés (5 jours)              |       |           | 2 054.44 |           |
| Complément Indemnité congés payés             |       |           | 679.59   |           |

In both cases, the overall result should be the same. It must comply with the calculation method we have agreed.

The 1/10th holiday payment is calculated as follows:

| Category | Pilot on Full Time | Pilot on AT90 | Pilot on AT75 | Pilot on AT50 | Pilot on AT77 | Pilot on ATS2 | Month On Month Off |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Period | 1st April to 31st March | 1st April to 31st March | 1st April to 31st March | 1st April to 31st March | 1st April to 31st March | 1st April to 31st March | 1st April to 31st March |
| Absence Deduction Rate | gross basic monthly / 25 | gross basic monthly / 19 | gross basic monthly / 20 | gross basic monthly / 13 | gross basic monthly / 13 | gross basic monthly / 20 | gross basic monthly / 25 |
| Maintain Calculation | (gross basic monthly/25) + 2.7 nominal sector | (gross basic monthly/19) + 2.7 nominal sector | (gross basic monthly/20) + 2.7 nominal sector | (gross basic monthly/13) + 2.7 nominal sector | (gross basic monthly/13) + 2.7 nominal sector | (gross basic monthly/20) + 2.7 nominal sector | (gross basic monthly/25) + 2.7 nominal sector |
| 1/10th Calculation | ((basic salary + variable) x 10%) / 25 | ((basic salary + variable) x 10%) / 19 | ((basic salary + variable) x 10%) / 20 | ((basic salary + variable) x 10%) / 13 | ((basic salary + variable) x 10%) / 13 | ((basic salary + variable) x 10%) / 20 | ((basic salary + variable) x 10%) / 13 |
| Number of Holiday Days | 5453: 27 / FFR: 30 | 26 days | 23 days | 15 days | 15 days | 24 days | 15 days |

### Sickness Pay (reference: NAO 2020)
Sick pay is relatively similar to the leave system. Note that thanks to the “Code des Transports”, the company does not apply any waiting period (“carence”) so you get paid from day one of sickness. In contrast, employees in the private sector normally get 3 days without pay.

SMMG (Salaire Minimum Mensuel Garanti” or "Guaranteed Monthly Minimum Salary") is an additional payment for each day of sickness to compensate for the loss of sectors, including days OFF (coded SIDO on AIMS).
To summarise, your basic salary is maintained, and you get 1 nominal sector on top for the first 3 months. We used to have 2 lines for a while:
* Absence Maladie: deduction of 1/30th of your monthly basic salary for each sick day.
* Maintien Absence Maladie: credit of 1/30th monthly basic + SMMG (1 nominal sector) for each sick day.

Recently we are back to 3 lines, where the third one displays the SMMG:

| Éléments                                   | Base  | Taux      | A payer   | A déduire |
|--------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Absence maladie 090719-100719              | -2.00 | 342.2960  |    		 | 684.59    |
| Maintien absence maladie 100%              |       |           | 684.59    |           |
| Complément Indemnité maladie               |       |           | 100.68    |           |

During Long Term Sickness and after 3 months your payments by easyJet will be lowered by 50%, and shown as:

| Éléments                                   | Base   | Taux      | A payer   | A déduire |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Absence maladie 010519-310519              | -31.00 | 365.8019  | 		  | 11 339.86 |
| Maintien absence maladie 50%               |        |           | 5 669.93  |           |
| Complément Indemnité maladie               |        |           | 1 560.54  |           |

And after another 3 months, payments by easyJet will stop entirely, however APPN will continue to pay you.

### IJSS - « Indemnité Journalière Sécurité Sociale »
These are paid when you are on sick leave or maternity or paternity leave. When SICK, a mechanism called “subrogation” forces EZY to pay in full those days on your payslip, and then EZY claims back those IJSS from Social Security. For you it makes no difference as you get a gross deduction on the upper part of the payslip, compensated by a net credit of the equivalent amount at the bottom of it. Total resulting in Zero. Tax: The IJSS appearing on the payslip will no be accounted for the PAS (no tax paid) and should not appear on the total net income declared by easyJet. During tax declaration, IJSS payments should be displayed separately in accordance with Social Security declaration to the tax of ce. It allows the administration to take those payments into account for the following tax rate calculation. If on Long Term Sick (LTS), maternity or paternity leave, beyond the period paid by easyJet (Maintien de salaire), the CPAM will pay the employee directly, provided that easyJet has sent an attestation to the CPAM. We strongly recommend you check with French payroll and the CPAM that the « attestation de salaire » has been sent in order to activate the payment.

### Accident at work
Similar to sickness payment except it does not trigger the daily nominal sector payment as per SMMG, but an average payment of the last 12 months variable pay instead.

### Ground Maternity
Payment Structure similar to Accident at work, but with an average calculated over the last 3 months.

### Abattement 30%
Document reference: NAO 2016
You will find a summary at the bottom of the payslip. Gross salary contribution base is lowered by 30% until reaching a total of 7600€ per year. This allows the company to pay less tax and has enabled us to get a pay rise in the past. This explains why your contributions are not based on the total gross amount calculated from the first part of the payslip, at least during the first few months of the calendar year, until the amount of 7600 € is reached:

| Cumul       | Salaire brut | Charges salariales | Charges patronales | Avantages en nature | Net imposable | Heures travaillées | Heures supplémentaires | Abattement |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------|
| Période     | 7 839,13     | 1 697,08           | 2 877,45           | 0,00                | 6 365,41      | 151,67             | 0,00                   | 2 351,74   |
| Année       | 18 087,05    | 3 823,97           | 6 516,70           | 0,00                | 14 778,43     | 303,34             | 0,00                   | 5 426,11   |

Note that your CRPN contribution is not affected by this calculation, so you get the full benefit of your salary for your pension scheme.

### Mutuelle - Complementary Health Cover

Referred as « Complémentaire Santé ». This is the company Health insurance, which is mandatory unless your partner already has a contract covering you which he/she cannot resign from. The mandatory payments are made via the payslip. Any additional cover (Option n°1 or Option n°2) will be deducted directly from your bank account. EasyJet contributes €9.31 per month.

### Complémentaire APPN
In the NAO 2017, the monthly fee for the PLT (Temporary Loss of Licence) increased. The difference is shown on your payslip, and below:

|       | SO   | FO/SFO | FO/SFO 75% | FO/SFO 50% | CPT   | CPT 75% | CPT 50% |
|-------|------|--------|------------|------------|-------|---------|---------|
| Value | €0   | €7     | €6         | €4         | €15   | €11     | €8      |


Also, APPN Permanent Loss of Licence cover, was introduced in October 2019 Both payments are combined. This is what it would look like on a Captain’s payslip:

| Santé                              |            |            |            |            |
|------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Prévoyance APPN - Captain Full time|            |            |   30.00    |   182.00   |


### APPN payments
Document Reference: NAO 2017

The payments of our APPN cover for Temporary LOL are split in 2 parts on the payslip:
* EJ Prévoyance (financement employeur) : Employer part
* EJ Prévoyance (financement salarié) : Employee part, worth about 10% of the cover.

This is due to the fact the contribution is split into 2 parts as well. The employee's part has to be treated as an insurance payment while the employer part as salary (hence contributions and tax).

### Réintégration Fiscale
This line reflects the value of the Complémentaire santé (mutuelle) which is paid by the company, that must be taxed as salary.

### 1st of May Payment
Document reference: ACCORD REMUNERATION 2014
If you have a duty on the 1st of May, you will be credited an additional 1/30 of your basic monthly salary. If you fly, your sector payments will be doubled. The uplift will appear on June’s payslip. Sectors sector being split in 2 parts. Payslip shows: “indemnité 1er mai” including basic and extra sectors payment. Supplementary payslip (CVP) will display sector payment and the extra sectors payment are combined under “special holiday pay”.

### Prime de remplacement (reference: NAO 2017)
These are payments for WIDO (Working into Day Off) and DDO (delayed into Day off). The payment is now automatic.

### Prime de disponibilité immédiate (reference: NAO 2018)
Short Notice Change: €68.28 per SNC.

### Prime discrétionnaire
Usually a penalty paid by payroll or a line used to pay a compensation with no registered title in their system.

### Crew Expenses
Since 1 January 2024, all expenses are refunded at the bottom of the payslip, and are exempt from taxation and social security contributions.

### Contributions
The company (Column Charges Patronales) and yourself (Column A déduire) both contribute. Social charges vary from around 20% to 26% due to some caps being reached for higher salaries. The base used to calculate the contributions is your gross salary. This base can be lowered by the Abattement 30%.

As you will notice, it is organised in groups : Health (Santé), State pension (Retraite), CRPN Pension, Unemployment (Chômage), CSG/CRDS…

Some contributions are only paid by the employer:
‣ Sécurité Sociale-Mal. Mat. Inval. Décès
‣ Accidents du travail & mal. professionnelles
‣ Famille
‣ Chômage
‣ Autres contributions

CSG / CRDS is only paid by the employee, and is displayed in 2 parts as a proportion of this contribution is still taxable, even if the money will never see your bank account! Some contribution bases are capped as a factor of the Plafond de le Sécurité Sociale (PSS), which is a reference value, revised annually:
* Sécurité Sociale plafonnée = (1 PSS)
* Fond de majoration TrA = (1 PSS)
* Chômage = (4 PSS)
(PSS = €3428 per month for 2020)

Some bases for contribution can be di erent from the gross salary in a few cases when elements from previous months have been carried over. It is calculated annually.

### Overtime

Firstly, the amount of your salary corresponding to the overtime deductible time is calculated. The overtime part of our contract applies to 15 hours of our basic salary (second line of the payslip) and to the variable pay linked to flight activity, with the same pro rata applied.

Essentially, 20% of our full time flying activity payment (sector pay, etc) is considered overtime:
(15*1,25 / 93,75 = 0,2)

The overtime deductible is calculated as follows:

Basic salary plus relevant variable pay                                  = A
Divide by 93.75 (90 flying hours plus 25% of the 15 overtime hours)      = B
Multiply by 15 (the 15 overtime hours)                                   = C
Multiply by 1.25 (increasing overtime rate by the 25%)                   = D
Overtime deductible                                                      = E
This example calculation is for a captain with €2 200 relevant variables:
	A ÷ B × C × D = E
		(salary of 11413.56 + variable of 2200) ÷ 93.75 × 15 × 1.25 = 2722.12
More info at: https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/actualites/A13182

This amount is used as a base contribution on which deductions will be performed on contributions and taxes:

### Exoneration Cotisation sur HC/HS:
Overtime amount x specific rate (max 11,31%)

### Exoneration Fiscale sur HC/HS:
Overtime amount capped at €5000 (€7500 in 2020) during the period of COVID sanitary measures.

### Corrections made by payroll:
That’s when you start to see funny things…When a credit from a previous month has to be cancelled, it appears as a negative credit of the same amount (and not a positive debit as you would think). Same for a debit, becoming a negative debit (a credit in fact). Are you still with us?

### Advance payment regularisation:

The missing payment is normally credited on the upper part (gross value) and a deduction of the net value (received in advance on the bank account) is made on the lower part of the Payslip. By doing so you fulfil with your obligations of paying contributions and tax on your salary received initially outside of the payslip.

### SAYE
Deducted at the end of the payslip as it is a net deduction. Obviously, the amount found should reflect the one you have decided to invest monthly when subscribing.

### Indemnité Uniforme
Uniform Allowance of €180 (full time, pro-rata for part time). Not subject to contributions or tax.

### « dont évolution de la rémunération liée à la suppression des cotisations chômage et maladie »
This value is only to highlight the gain made by the lowered contributions with last laws introduced by Président Macron. Government self’s promotion!

### PAS (Prélèvement à la source)
Tax deduction directly on salary, introduced in January 2019. The rate is calculated individually by the tax office and given every month to payroll by the fiscal administration.

### Salaries
There are 4 salaries we get to talk about.
* Gross salary: The one paid by EZY before contributions are deducted = “Salaire brut”
* Net salary: The one we used to be paid, before Tax deduction was introduced = “Net à payer avant impôt sur le revenu”
* Taxable salary: Different from the Net salary = line « Impôt sur le revenu prélevé à la source – PAS »
* Paid salary: The one that finally gets to your bank account = “Net payé”. As you can see, France is a high tax country and you often gets less than half of your gross

### Net taxable calculation
Gross salary - Total des cotisations et contributions + CSG non deductible + Exonération cotisation + Réintégration fiscale + Prévoyance APPN (employee) - Exonération Fiscale = Taxable salary used for PAS deduction

## PAY - VARIABLE PAY
ADTY [Airport Duty] Pay:

* 0 - 3h59 of airport duty = automatic payment of 1 nominal sector
* Over 4 hours : automatic payment of 2 nominal sectors (Not applicable to Second Officers)

If employee is called to fly within the first 4 hours only the sectors flown will be paid.
If the employee is called after 4 hours, 1 nominal sector plus the sectors flown will be paid.

### Night Stop
Night Stops are normally paid automatically, except when they are preceded or followed by a non-duty day such as a D/O, REST, SICK, IDO or DDO, in which case a duty payment form must be submitted.

### Positioning
All ground positioning is paid 1 nominal sector, regardless of the number of sectors or their length.

### Supplemental Payslip
All elements of variable pay are listed on a supplemental payslip which is issued on the 15th of the month, for variable pay accrued in the preceding month. All elements of variable pay, except those listed below, are captured.

### Claiming a Duty Payment
You must submit a manual duty payment claim for the following:
* Working into a day off following a night stop away from base
* Special Night stops on a D/O for Crewing or Training Delivery's convenience. These night stops, not followed by a duty, must be claimed manually
	1. Download the Duty Payment Form from the crewportal/Forms/pilot forms library;
	2. Fill in the Duty Payment Form, be aware you only need to indicate the number of nights and not the number of sector pay;
	3. Drop the Duty Payment Form in the grey training box in the crew room. Try to submit the claim before the 3rd of the month, for inclusion in the current month payroll.

### SMMG
SMMG applies to periods of sickness, to maintain the normal revenue. [it shows on the payslip as maintien compt garanti du net].
Payroll compares the monthly payments made with the SMMG and applies a top up if needed. The SMMG is dependent on individual rank and seniority. It is the net salary before tax a pilot would receive while being put on home standby with zero flights. This additional top up made by the company is paid in gross on the payslip and calculated to guarantee the net amount of the SMMG.

## PAY - PENSION
In a French contract, all pilots contribute to two pension schemes:

### State Pension
All employees subject to social security in France contribute to the universal state pension, which allows you to retire between 62 & 67 years old. For more information, visit the assurance retraite website.

### Caisse de Retraite du Personnel Navigant
The CRPN is a mandatory, complementary pension for all flight crew in France. Contributions are fixed at a proportion of your total salary. Upon retiring, your monthly pension is based on the number of years you contributed to the CRPN, or worked as flight crew in the EU, and your salary.

[Diagrams from CPRN removed due complexity, see CRPN website for further information]

### E205
When you will decide to take your pension, you’ll have to request it through the pension service of your country of residence. To reconstruct your career, your pension service will request a E205 form from every countries where you have worked in, order to prove your rights. If you have worked in the UK, the SNPL recommends you to request your UK E205 as soon as possible to ensure pension rights are carried across. To request your E205 now, send an email to the CRPN: affilies@crpn.fr using this template:

```
Objet : Demande UK E205
Bonjour,
J’ai besoin de mon attestation UK E205 pour la reconstruction de ma carrière.
Suivant l’accord avec Easyjet, veuillez adresser ma demande au service anglais en
charge des retraites. Mon numéro de sécurité sociale anglais est: AA 12 23 45 B
Merci de bien vouloir me prévenir dès la réception du document.
Bien cordialement,
Your Name
```
More information about the options and processes of retiring are mentioned in our dedicated LIFE - Retirement section.

### Changes to the CRPN

Until 31/12/2020
The payment of Employee contributions to the CRPN validates the time in service for pension calculation. The payment of employer contributions validates the overall contributions (Employee + Employer). What we called validation in time + money.

From 01/01/2021
The validation for CRPN (Time + Money) is now linked to the payment of a salary to the employee. Once registered on the DSN (Déclaration Sociale Nominative), which is compiled monthly by the employer, it increases your contributions (employee + employer) at the CRPN. Even if the contributions are not paid at the end (in case of bankruptcy for exemple).

### Partial Activity (activité partielle)
In 2020, the indemnities perceived by employees for AP, did generate some time in service, but no associated contributions. Contributions were only paid on gross salary and credited as such at CRPN. From 01/01/2021, the CRPN will validate (time + money) the amounts received as AP or APLD indemnities. There will be no contributions associated, but virtual reconstruction of the Gross salary will be operated. Those extra pension credits will be compensated by an increase of the contribution rates from 2024.

### Employer Contributions
The possibility has been offered for employers to postpone the payments of Employer contributions, on the condition of paying the employee contributions in full. easyJet has used this possibility for a few months. It has no impact on employees leaving the business (RCC, APC refusal, retirement, dismissal…). In those cases, the contributions have to be paid in full to allow correct pension calculation.

## PAY - WIDO / WFLY
All pilots must be off duty by 23:59 local time prior to a day-off. Any time on duty past 00:00 local, will be considered as working into a day off: WIDO.
It will be assumed that pilots will WIDO unless the pilot informs crewing otherwise. When it becomes apparent that working into a day off is a probability, and the pilot intends to decline, crewing shall be informed as soon as is practicable.
Pilots are not obliged to WIDO.

WIDO from 00:01-01:30 local time is considered an Delayed Day off (DDO)
WIDO from 01:31 local time or later is considered an Infringed Day off (IDO)

### Compensation
Pilots will be compensated for WIDO as follows:
- Replacement in full of the IDO as OWED
- Replacement of the DDO, after the 3rd occurrence, as OWED
- Automatic payment as per the following table, in the month following the WIDO:

| RANK | DDO Rate   | IDO Rate   | WFLY Rate  |
|------|------------|------------|------------|
| TRE  | €726,15    | €1452,30   | €1815,37   |
| TRI  | €710,70    | €1421,40   | €1776,75   |
| LTC  | €695,25    | €1390,50   | €1738,12   |
| CAPT | €618,00    | €1236,00   | €1545,00   |
| SFO  | €376,33    | €752,65    | €940,82    |
| FO   | €306,78    | €613,56    | €766,95    |
| SO   | €210,15    | €420,29    | €525,36    |

If you finish your duty away from your own base and position or operate a flight home on your day off, the the IDO must be claimed manually in workday: Workday -> Requests -> Create Request -> Request type = All -> Duty Claim Form.

### Replacement of DDO / IDO
The Day Off repayment protocol as per the current DGAC-FTL agreement Chapter X.3, translates as:
"When the actual duty finishes after 0130L on a Day Off, the infringed day off will be regranted on the next roster, or at any other time agreed between the pilot and the company. On the first 3 occasions in a calendar year that a day off is infringed by 90 minutes or less, it will not be re-granted."

The online Owed day Off request form is only to be completed if either an IDO has occurred or this is the fourth occasion (or more) of a DDO occurring. In order to receive a day off repayment, pilots will primarily use the owed day form available on the crew portal offering the following options:
- Please assign my Owed day to any week-end day within the next 3 roster months
- Please assign my Owed day to any day within the next unpublished roster
- Please assign my Owed day to any of the following dates (5 non guaranteed)
- Please attach my Owed day to a block of D/O within the next 3 roster months
- Alternatively, they can send an email to the PSO or to the BC
Important: The term “repayment” is used for the replacement of DDO / IDO. This is separate to the WIDO payment, in the table above.

The OWED day will be identified as such in the roster via a memo.

Ref. NTC ADM 133/19, the underlying principle in event of WIDO is to go not below one day below the minimum conventional D/O allocation of the pattern in the month. As such an OWED must be repaid as required in the same month to keep the minimum D/O allocation minus one. In the case where, for example, a minimum D/O requirement is 12:
- First IDO/DDO: no immediate repayment required, however it may be requested for the next month by contacting the PSO.
- Second or more IDO/DDO: must be replaced on the current month or the block immediately following if the WIDO was the last day of the month.

### Willing to Fly
Any D/O or P/T day may be switched to Willing to Fly in AIMS. Once the WFLY has been placed, it may not be removed. Placing WFLY does not oblige the pilot to accept a flight on the day. A pilot may not express a preference for a specific flight to be assigned to a WFLY. Once a duty (flight or standby) has been placed, the "$"" will appear on e-crew for that day and the payment is due. Willing to fly D/O will not be replaced after being allocated. A pilot requires 14h notice for WFLY. In the event of mass disruption, crewing may attempt contact a pilot to assign a duty with less notice. If accepting, consider fatigue implications carefully.

### Leave Buy-Back

The Leave buy-back facility is applicable to all pilots on a French contract at the same pay rate as the IDO payment (see above). Pilot management may offer to buy back leave, this is separate to the WFLY process. The leave day is credited to be used at a later date.

## PAY - EXPENSES
### Crew Expenses
All expense claims must be submitted within 3 months of the expense being incurred, as stated in the Expense Policy (section 10 of the People Handbook) which can be found on the intranet. You always need an original receipt in order to submit an expense claim.

To submit an expense:
* On Connected Portal, click on the Crew Expenses tab and complete the online expense claim form. Please read the attached Expense Matrix to help you throughout this step
* You will then receive an automatic email confirming receipt of your claim, and the reference

### Exceptional Expenses
As part of your activity, you may encounter exceptional costs such as having to purchase food for the crew in the terminal, or advance the cost for transfer to/from hotel after an unscheduled night stop. These costs must be fully reimbursed and are not subject to social security the rebate.
In order to be fully reimbursed, expenses must simultaneously fulfil 3 criteria:
* Exceptional character; minimum amount €180

To submit a claim, fill out the Exceptional Claim Form in the crew room and sign it, then send it in PDF format to expenses@easyjet.com It will then be sent to your line manager who will verify and approve it. Agresso payments are independent from payroll and will be sent directly to your bank account.

### Public Transport Expenses
easyJet pays 50% of the cost of your subscription to public transportations or bicycle rental service for the travel between your usual residence and your base provided you do not have a parking card. Even if you subscribe to a first class subscription, the reimbursement will always be based on the second-class fare. If several subscriptions are required to complete your journey, easyJet will cover 50% of these different subscriptions. Employees under alternate time patterns receive the same reimbursement.

### How to claim
For an initial application: Request the claim form from your base team, complete it and send it to HR Service Centre with the certificate of transport contract including the related period and proof of payment:
- Renewal if annual subscription: Request the claim form from your base team, complete it and send it to HR Service Centre with the certificate of transport contract including the related period and proof of payment
- Renewal if monthly/weekly subscription: Every month or week as applicable, send the certificate of transport contract including the related period and proof of payment to HR Service Centre. You will need to complete the initial application form and submit it every January.

For a change of situation: Fill out the form and send it to HR Service Centre with the relevant supporting documents. Point out in your email that this is due to a situation change. Attach the certificate of transport contract including the related period and proof of payment.

Terms of refund: Upon receipt of the requested documents, the refund will be made on your following month payslip. For employees under an annual subscription with an 11 month payment plan, the reimbursement will be divided into 12 monthly instalments. The amount of the reimbursement for your public transports or subscription to a public bike rental service is included at the bottom of your payslip (it is not subject to any contribution). Should you have any questions, please contact your Human Resources Department.

## PAY - CSG/CRDS
This is applicable to NON-TAX RESIDENTS
When you contribute into the French social system as a non-resident you’re not liable to the CSG/CRDS tax. For non-residents this tax is replaced by a higher contribution for the social security. The increase is 4.75%, while the CSG/CRDS tax is about 9.70%. So there’s a gain of 4.95%.
Remark: Should you have been based in France as a non-resident in the past years, you can not only ask for the CSG/CRDS to be replaced by the higher social security contribution, but you can also ask for a back payment of the difference over the last 3 years.

How to proceed when this procedure is applicable to you?
Contact both frenchpayroll@easyjet.com and hrfrance@easyjet.com
Example of your letter in French :

```
Bonjour,
	Par ce mail je tiens à vous informer de mon statut de non-résident français et que je ne suis donc pas assujettie au paiement de la CSG-CRDS. Je vous joins mon avis d'imposition ……. pour l'année….et …. Pour l’année …. la déclaration doit encore se faire, cependant je vous joins le certi cat de résidence scale valable jusqu’au …….. Je vous prie d’annuler les prélèvements CSG-CRDS, qui engendrent une cotisation salariale d’assurance maladie à un taux majoré (4,75%).
	Bien cordialement, …….
```
Attach the following documents :
	* Proof that you’re a non-resident in France, eg. electricity bill of your home residence
	* Your last tax statement. For back payment, attach statements for the last 3 years
	* A certificate to prove your tax residence. Your tax office can provide a standard EU form

## PAY - SHARES
### Performance Shares
Performance shares are awarded to employees on years where financial targets have been met. This is an opt-out system, you must notify easyJet if you do not wish to accept the reward. 2 years after their award date, the shares vest. You may then transfer them to an account, managed by equinity, or to the Groupama employee savings plan. By choosing the equinity scheme, you become the owner of the shares. You may sell them after a further year. The groupama scheme places the shares in a fund that matches their value, and becomes available after 5 years. At the vesting date, you may choose to place some or all (max 7.5% of the PASS) of your shares in to the PEE managed by Groupama. Under this arrangement, you are not the owner of the shares, but you do not pay income tax on capitals gains.

### Intéressement / Participation
In France, a further performance bonus is awarded directly into the groupama employee savings plan. You may choose to place the amount awarded in a number of funds.

### Buyback or arbitration of your easyJet shares
If you want to buyback or arbitrate your shares, it is not possible to do this online. Follow the following process: All requests must be sent by email to the following address: relation.clients.groupama@gieges.fr.
Include a copy of your identity card, and a RIB in your name.
If your share buyback request is a partial buyback request for easyJet securities, the amount to be redeemed and the number of easyJet shares to be redeemed (1 unit = 1 Share in easyJet FCPE) should be specified. If this is a total buyback request of available assets in all funds combined: specify that it is a total buyback. In the case of an arbitrage request from FCPE easyJet to other fund(s): specify the amount of the shares available to arbitrate and the support (s) of destination and precise the proportion to allocate to each destination fund. All other requests are directly managed on your secure online account. The buyback requests and arbitrations will be made for free.

## MISC - BASE TRANSFER
As per the EASA Base Transfer process, the requirement around BFER/TFER is that you must be free from duty for 72 hours before your first duty in your new base and achieve 3 local nights. The rules applicable to a BFER day are:
1. Before roster publication, Rostering may add a flight before before a BFER, adjusting times if necessary.
2. After roster publication, PreOps and/or Crewing may not add a flight before a BFER, though the times of the BFER may be adjusted to allow for rest issues.

## MISC - CLASS 1 MEDICAL
Your medical renewal must take place at least 10 calendar days before expiry. easyJet does not allocate a working day for the class 1 medical renewal, you must do this in your own free time. If you struggle to obtain an appointment within the published roster period, contact your PSO for assistance.

## MISC - AUSTROCONTROL
All pilots operating in France, on the Austrian AOC, hold AustroControl licences. For queries about licensing or english-language proficiency, contact: piloten@austrocontrol.at

### Rating Renewal & Revalidation
With Austrocontrol, any EASA examiner may endorse your licence provided the rating is already mentioned. To renew or revalidate a rating, obtain and complete the appropriate form, then send along with a scan of your newly endorsed licence and a scan of your examiner’s licence and medical to piloten@austrocontrol.at

## MISC - CREW FOOD
Crew food is provisioned according to the Crew Food Menu document available on Docunet.
Note that FDP is usually 30 minutes shorter than the duty period, except when positioning after a FDP. The menu departure time is 1h later than a standard report.

### Lack of / Insufficient crew food
If no crew food is delivered to the aircraft the captain is entitled to purchase food in the terminal and will be reimbursed up to £10 (approx €11) per crew member. If crew food is incomplete, non-alcoholic items may be taken from the bar (NTC UK-ADM 110/18 & OMA 8.10.1.6) If the oven is inoperative, cold food such as a salad may be provided to replace the hot meal.

### Delays
If catered adequately for a 09:55 duty (less than 10h) and you pick up delay for any reason, exceeding 10h duty, you may then consider that you have been incorrectly catered for the day. You may then top-up the catering from the bar.

## MISC - RANK UPGRADE
Upon joining easyJet, you will be assigned a rank based on whether you joined as a cadet or direct-entry pilot (DEP) in accordance with the table below. Subsequent upgrades follow the same hour brackets.

| Factored Hours | Licence         | Rank | Min. time in rank |
|----------------|-----------------|------|--------------------|
| < 1250         | Frozen ATPL     | SO   | 24 months*        |
| < 3000         | Frozen ATPL     | FO   | -                 |
| > 3000         | Full EASA ATPL  | SFO  | -                 |
* minimum duration in rank credits all time flown for easyJet regardless of contract. Not applicable to DEP (Direct Entry Pilots).

To action your rank upgrade, you must send an email to your PSO (cc Base Captain) with the following forms attached:
* Upgrade FRA Rank Identification Form found in the Base Pages / HR / agreements, guides & processes
* Factored Hours Form found on the connected portal / DOC / Pilot Forms Library

### Special arrangements for pregnant female Pilots
In order to mitigate the delays in the female Pilots career progression due to pregnancy, the minimum factored hour criteria for a promotion to FO or SFO ranks is reduced by 40 factored hours per month spent in maternity (identified on AIMS by the MTRN code – where she cannot work flying as a pilot).

### ATPL Unfreeze / PICUS Hours
PICUS time may be logged on all sectors where FO is PF. The Base Captain will provide a certificate for the hours completed, having reviewed the flight log and AIMS statements. This certificate is sufficient to validate the hours of PICUS. There is no need for the Captain's signature on every flight. NTC ADM 9/20 explains the process to unfreeze the ATPL. All pilots who did not take part in the easyJet licence transfer process from UK to AustroControl are liable to pay the full €1250 fee.
